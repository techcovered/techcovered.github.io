    <h1>How to Type Fast without Looking at the Screen in Android</h1>
    <p class="muted">07 April 2014</p>
	<hr>
    <p>Typing fast on your keyboard is cool, but you what what’s cooler? Typing fast on your phone! With the advent of full-touch screen phones, typing hasn’t exactly been a strong point of those phones. Nothing could replace the versatility of a physical keyboard. However, things got more easier when Android phones could support third party keyboard apps, and a new app in town “Swype” could help you type faster without lifting your finger off the screen.</p>

<p>But this does not answer the question – How do you type without looking at your phone screen? For instance, if you go to school and you regularly text in class, it would be much more ideal if you could type without looking at your phone screen. The same applies if you are at a meeting, or in any situation where looking down at your phone frequently could get you into trouble.</p>

<h3 id="a-typing-with-a-little-looking">a. Typing with a little looking</h3>

<p>It may be a bit difficult to type large walls of text from your phone without even looking at your phone a bit. If you are in a situation which permits you to type with occasional glances to your phone, then you can type more efficiently without having to hit backspace often. Here are some keyboard apps which let you do this:</p>

<h3 id="fleksy-keyboardhttpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomsyntelliafleksykb">1. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.syntellia.fleksy.kb">Fleksy Keyboard</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://techcovered.github.io/images/Fleksy.png" alt="Fleksy" /></p>

<p>There is something about this keyboard which sets it apart from the rest. The keyboard, as it advertises, is pretty forgiving on almost all sorts of spelling mistakes you make while typing. In fact, this keyboard has been known to correct the word even if all the characters have been typed wrong. It also has gestures which include swiping left for backspace, right for space, etc, which makes it all the more easy to use.</p>

<p>This keyboard is so good, you can comfortably type without looking, but only if you know your way around the QWERTY character placement in a usual keyboard, regardless of how much mistakes you make.</p>

<p><img src="https://techcovered.github.io/images/swiftkey.png" alt="swiftkey" /></p>

<p>SwiftKey is one of those apps which has come to define the android app industry. It is one of the few apps which constantly tops the list of top paid apps in Google’s Play Store, and for a reason.</p>

<p>Though swiftkey is mainly a swype keyboard, where you have to constantly look at your screen as you swipe through characters, it’s main strong point is its prediction and auto correct. I have never come across a keyboard app which offers so much accuracy in auto correction and also offers predictive text which suggest the words you are probably going to use next. If you are a fast typer, you can disable the swype part of the keyboard by disabling “Flow” in the settings.</p>

<p>If there is no way you can type/text in a situation, but you desperately need to, then fret not – there’s a way.</p>

<p>Morse Code has been used since the days of telegraph and the early military, and now you can use it to update your Facebook status in class too!</p>

<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.emergent.android.morseime">Morse Code Keyboard</a> is a god sent app for people who desperately need to type without having to look at their phones one bit. The trick involved is to use the ‘ . ’ and ‘ - ’ in different combinations to generate characters, which will make up words, which will eventually make up sentences. For example, two dashes and two dots represent ‘Z’ on the morse code. You can have the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:International_Morse_Code.svg">entire list here</a>. Another alternate for this keyboard is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rgam.morsekeyboard">Morse Keyboard</a></p>

<p>If anyone remembers, Google played an April fool prank, by introducing an “revolutionary” keyboard app, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KhZKNZO8mQ">Gmail Tap</a>. Basically, the morse code apps provided perform the same task as the prank advertises. So, joke is on them?</p>
