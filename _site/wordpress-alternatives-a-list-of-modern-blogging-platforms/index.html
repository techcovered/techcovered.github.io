    <h1>WordPress Alternatives :  A list of Modern Blogging Platforms</h1>
    <p class="muted">13 October 2014</p>
	<hr>
    <p>WordPress is almost a synonym with the word <em>blogging</em>, but times are changing and there are many new web services which provide so many different options for a blogger to choose from. WordPress no longer remains the exclusive <em>go-to</em> option if someone wants to blog.</p>

<p>Here is a list of few modern WordPress alternatives:</p>

<h2 id="mediumhttpmediumcom">1. <a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a></h2>

<p>From the founders of Twitter, Medium has slowly, but surely emerged as one of the most talked about blogging platform. Unlike the conventional platforms, Medium focuses solely on the content, providing you with a rich set of tools like its very impressive WYSIWYG editor and its simplistic design, which looks somewhat similar to this website.  (Guilty as charged, I did take inspiration from their design).</p>

<p><img src="images/medium.png" alt="Medium-Blog" /></p>

<p>However, unlike WordPress, Medium doesn’t allow you to customize your “blog” at all. As a matter of fact, you don’t even have a blog to start with - imagine it to be something like twitter, except you write blog posts instead of tweets.</p>

<p>There are also some controversies regarding who actually owns the content you publish on Medium. You can read their <a href="https://medium.com/policy/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f">terms and conditions here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ghosthttpghostorg">2. <a href="http://ghost.org/">Ghost</a></h2>

<p>Ghost is a new entrant, and is surprisingly stable and feels mature enough to compete with the 10 year older WordPress. Ghost was built on the idea that a blogging platform shouldn’t be heavy, but should be lightweight instead. After a very successful kickstarter, Ghost was made and became popular enough to make people sit up and notice.</p>

<p>Ghost is similar to WordPress. It is an open source project and you need to download it and install it on your server to host your blog - or - you can pay Ghost Foundation to host your blog on their servers.</p>

<p>One interesting feature of Ghost blog editor if the way you post - through markups.</p>

<p><img src="images/ghost-blog-editor.png" alt="ghost blog post editor" /></p>

<p>There are also plenty of themes being made and sold for this platform, and is being touted by everyone as the WordPress killer. While that is not entirely true, it does seem to be a strong contender.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of Ghost blogs:  <a href="http://blog.apericore.com/upgrading-your-ghost-blog-platform/">Apericore blog</a>, <a href="http://mariusmasalar.me/">Mauris Malasar</a></p>

<h2 id="github-pageshttpspagesgithubcom">3. <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a></h2>

<p>Yes. You read that right. Github - the git repository which all programmers swear with their lives can also be used to host your own blog - for free.</p>

<p>Github Pages allows you to host a website on their servers for free. However, they allow you only one website. You can store <em>_static_</em> web pages here.</p>

<p>So, here come the mighty <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, an open source project which dynamically generates static websites for your Github Pages website. You dont have to worry about managing databases, pages, permalinks, categories, etc. as they are all taken care of. You can also have a custom domain name for your website/blog.</p>

<p>Setting up your blog initially requires a lot of work - for instance, your blog’s repository name ( xxxxxxx.github.io ) must match your username (in this case, xxxxxxx ). Also, you have to run a couple of lines of code to set up your blog and then Jekyll (<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/">Instructions</a>).</p>

<p>If, for some reason, you don’t like Jekyll, you can try <a href="http://www.developmentseed.org/blog/2012/june/25/prose-a-content-editor-for-github/">Prose.io</a> to manage a blog without all its related problems.</p>

<h2 id="squarespacesquarespacecom">4. <a href="squarespace.com">Squarespace</a></h2>

<p>Squarespace is paid. However, Squarespace lets you create totally <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/templates">professional looking websites</a> , which can serve from anything - a wedding invitation page to a business website. You can also use it to build your blog, fully SEO optimised with lots of customization options and also have a free custom domain if you sign up for their services.</p>

<p>It offers a 14 day trial for you to “experience” Squarespace before you sign up for their services.</p>

<p><img src="images/squarespace.png" alt="squarespace-blog" /></p>

<p>That being said, if you think you need a unique professional looking blog/website and dont mind paying for it, then Squarespace is what you were looking for.</p>

<p>Here are a few blogs hosted by Squarespace: <a href="http://darrenbooth.com/">Darren Booth</a>, <a href="http://www.mariohugo.com/">Mario Hugo</a>, <a href="http://jmcreative.com/">JM Creative</a>.</p>

<h2 id="svbtlehttpssvbtlecom">5. <a href="https://svbtle.com/">Svbtle</a></h2>

<p>Svbtle is another blogging platform, which recently moved from a free-to-use to a $6-a-month fee. Svbtle uses a content-first design, and that is pretty much worth talking about this platform.</p>

<p><img src="images/svbtle.png" alt="svbtle-blog" /></p>

<p>Svbtle first used an invitation-only system to register bloggers - allowing only popular celebrities to blog and opened up to public only very recently. A lot of features are missing for the general population. There are also many complaints about new features being added or changed without users being notified.</p>

<p>Svbtle uses a markdown editor for writing posts, and an example of a blog using svbtle is <a href="http://dcurt.is/">dcurt.is</a>.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-about-wordpress">So, what about WordPress?</h2>

<p>WordPress is not under an immediate threat. It still is the most popular blogging platform, though it needs to think with its feet to move well ahead of its competitors.</p>

<p>As of this blog post, WordPress is still my first choice in blogging.</p>
