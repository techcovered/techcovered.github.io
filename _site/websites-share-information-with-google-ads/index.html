    <h1>Do Websites Share Information with Google for Ads? Yes. They do.</h1>
    <p class="muted">08 September 2013</p>
	<hr>
    <p>The most strange thing happened.</p>

<p>I was on Flipkart, a popular Indian shopping site, looking for some mobile phones to drool over. I first saw the Nexus 4, then the HTC one, followed by Samsungâ€™s S4 and then the LG Optimus G. After I finished my browsing session with the website,I headed over to another site and was surprised, if not shocked, to see the products which I had gone through in Flipkart, in the Google Ads on that page.</p>

<p><img src="https://techcovered.github.io/images/ads-surfed_thumb.png" alt="ads-surfed" /></p>

<p>This brings us to the grand question(s). Do websites share information with Google Ads to display more relevant advertisements? Do all the websites do this or only a selected few? Is there any opt-out policy to not be tracked this way? Is privacy really dead?</p>

<p>Here are a few answers I inferred:</p>

<p>1) Yes. Websites seem to share some information with Google regarding the pages you visited in their site. This seems to be done by the cookies the websites use and which Google Ads read from your browser.</p>

<p>2) As far as I have found out, a few shopping sites like Flipkart and Amazon have implemented this. But if this method guarantees more clicks for ads, then expect a lot more websites to implement this.</p>

<p>3) Google has an <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin">opt-out plugin</a> for your browser which continuously tells Google to not consider you for any ads which are related to your browsing history or interests. Additionally, to be on the safe side, if you are dealing with sensitive information/data, it is always recommended you use the Private Browsing/ Incognito without signing into Google.</p>

<p>4) This is a tough question to answer. While privacy is tougher to obtain in these times, it is certainly not dead.</p>

<p>Have you ever come across these advertisements? Do let us know.</p>
