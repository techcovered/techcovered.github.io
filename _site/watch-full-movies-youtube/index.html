    <h1>Watch Full Length Movies on YouTube for Free</h1>
    <p class="muted">11 May 2014</p>
	<hr>
    <p><a href="www.youtube.com/user/movies">YouTube movies</a> is a movie streaming service on YouTube, where you can pay a fee for “renting out” a movie, which you can watch within YouTube itself. However, the pricing of the movies aren’t that attractive, with some movies costing as much as $10 per viewing. Other streaming sites like Netflix and even Hulu are considerably better priced.</p>

<p><img src="http://img.techcovered.org/tc/youtube_movies.png" alt="youtube_movies" /></p>

<p>However, unknown to many people, some publishers release their movies on YouTube for free viewing, which you can stream without paying for it. These do not include very popular titles, but do include some well known movies which as good enough to spend your time watching.</p>

<p><a href="http://zerodollarmovies.com/">Zero Dollar Movies</a> is a website which lists a constantly updated version of all YouTube movies which are free to view. Similar sites are <a href="http://www.moviefork.com/">Movie Fork</a> and <a href="http://fullmovies.cc/">Fullmovies.cc</a>. The websites update themselves with a list of full length movies periodically, so the list never gets stale.</p>

<p>There are also many forums on the internet which gives links to legally and questionably legal uploads of popular movies. One such place on the internet, is the sub-reddit <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/fullmoviesonyoutube/">/r/FullMoviesOnYouTube</a>. Here, users submit YouTube links to movies, which are commented upon by other users, who ,in some cases, also provide videos with better quality and subtitles.</p>

<p>There are also plenty of channels and playlists on YouTube, which have a huge list of free to watch movies. Some of the popular ones are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF7198D24E5EC5B3C">this</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEE54950D026DAC24">this</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Tromamovies">this one</a>. There are lots of channels similar to this, all of which are just a Google search away. There are also plenty of channels which contain lots of great documentaries (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jaypee1154">for example</a>), which are legally free to watch. There are tons of amateur movie productions which are freely viewable too.</p>
