    <h1>Use AdBlock Plus to Remove Social Buttons and Trackers from the Web</h1>
    <p class="muted">24 July 2013</p>
	<hr>
    <p>As a blogger and a web publisher, I only advise people to not use Adblock as many websites depend on advertising revenue for their sustenance. However, Adblock of late, has evolved to be a much more better extension than the previous versions in which it just unwittingly blocks ads.</p>

<p>Of late, <strong><a href="http://adblockplus.org/">Adblock</a></strong> has started to allow ads (by default) which are less intrusive and less likely to bother you in any way. However, this default “whitelist” is a very short list and only a few ad slots of a few top sites are whitelisted. If you would like to show support for any website or blog that you follow or you like, then please do turn adblock off.</p>

<p><img src="images/adblock.png" alt="adblock" /></p>

<p>The most interesting feature is Adblock’s ability to disable social networking plugins and share buttons, which is optional, however. According to Adblock plus, since these social networks track your browser habits and an accidental (or thoughtless) click on these plugins or share buttons might reveal your “browsing habits” to all your friends and followers.</p>

<p>Facebook, Twitter, Delicious, Digg, Reddit, Tumblr, Stumble Upon, Fark (?!) and a <a href="https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/fanboy-social.txt">lot more websites</a> are completely removed of their buttons from the internet. However, these websites themselves do work well.</p>

<p>Websites that also track you, for mostly analytical reasons (like visitor information, content viewed, page views) can also be blocked. This list means that people who have this option enabled will be almost invisible to website administrators. Popular analytics sites like Google Analytics, Adobe’s Fidelity, and <a href="https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easyprivacy.txt">a lot more</a> are also blocked.</p>

<p>There is, of course, the ever useful malware blocking option, which prevents the loading of known malicious sites. If you have an antivirus, it should do the job too.</p>

<p>These options are a one-time-show only. Meaning: They aren’t visible after your first time installing. To access them again, follow these links for <a href="chrome-extension://cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb/firstRun.html">Chrome</a> and <a href="chrome://adblockplus/content/ui/firstRun.html">Firefox</a>.</p>
