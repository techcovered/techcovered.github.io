    <h1>The New Techcovered - Why the Shift to Wordpress?</h1>
    <p class="muted">03 March 2013</p>
	<hr>
    <p>After using Blogger for nearly two years, I finally made the shift from Blogger to WordPress. This step came after I was not satisfied with the search ranking that Google gave to my blog. After as much as 200 high quality articles, the search results no where contained links to my blog, even after the use of VERY specific keywords. Shame on Google, I’d say.</p>

<p><img src="https://techcovered.github.io/images/2013/03/blogger-to-wordpress.jpg" alt="Reasons why I shifted from Blogger to Wordpress" /></p>

<p>But Google is not really to blame here. Google’s algorithm has a mind of its own, not that its a bad thing. Most of the blogger blogs out there are spam and short lived ones, and it is not Google’s fault if it treats every blogspot link with the same amount of suspicion.</p>

<p>And somehow, mysteriously, Google’s official blog still manages to come up much ahead in search results that are even partially related to it. Kind of fishy, but its high readership and pageviews clears the air a bit.</p>

<p>The next reason - well, is again somewhat related to SEO. Wordpress is much much more SEO customizable than blogger. Nothing to prove here.</p>

<p>The third reason is customizability. Blogger is customizable too, probably the most customizable in all the free blogs out there, but self-hosted wordpress can’t be overthrown in this regard. Hell, you can even delete an important file in wordpress without it not allowing you to do so (though its a stupid thing to do and your wordpress installation wont work after that)</p>

<p>The fourth is for readership. Surveys say that wordpress blogs have more readership than blogger blogs. (Which survey? Well, I made it up, okay? But the fact is obvious!) Most of my blogger blog viewers are just one-page viewers, who probably run away from the blog as soon as their quest is answered. But on wordpress, you actually have a shot at a good readership (conditions apply).</p>

<p>If you have no time to read this, here is a quick brief:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Because Google doesn’t treat Blogger blog worthy enough</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More SEO customization</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More customizability - themes, plugins, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To build up a readership base (impossible with blogger)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Why do I blog? Well, you could ask me the meaning of life and that answer would have been simpler. [ <a href="http://sugarstudiosdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/blogger-wordpress.jpg">Image credits </a>]</p>
