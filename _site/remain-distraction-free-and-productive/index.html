    <h1>How to Be Productive and Remain Distraction Free</h1>
    <p class="muted">28 November 2014</p>
	<hr>
    <p>You need the will power of a Zen monk to stay true to yourself and your work, especially when you are sitting in front of a computer or mobile device with internet access. However, with enough dedication, it is actually really simple to remain productive and not be distracted.</p>

<p>Here are a few tried and tested methods that’ll help you get on track.</p>

<h2 id="a-blocking-websites">a. Blocking Websites</h2>

<p>There is no way to put this mildly. If you want to get work done, all those websites you usually visit to kill time, have to be blocked.</p>

<p>There are a lot of easy ways to do this. You can use a couple of <a href="http://www.techcovered.org/648/maximize-productivity-time-saving-tools">browser extensions</a> to do the trick for you.</p>

<p>You can also do it the hard way, by blocking these websites in your hosts file. To do this, you need System level access of the computer you use. The host file can be found depending on what OS you use.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span style="color: #ff0000;"&gt;Windows Vista/7/8:
&lt;/span&gt;C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts

&lt;span style="color: #ff0000;"&gt;Linux:
&lt;/span&gt;/etc/hosts

&lt;span style="color: #ff0000;"&gt;Mac OSX:
&lt;/span&gt;/private/etc/hosts
</code></pre>

<p>To block the host file, simply type your computer’s local address, followed by the URL of the website you wish to block. If you wish to block Facebook and Reddit, for example, your host file should contain this:</p>

<pre><code>127.0.0.1                   facebook.com
127.0.0.1                   reddit.com
</code></pre>

<h2 id="b-stop-im">b. Stop IM</h2>

This next step is more common sense than ‘tip’. If you plan on working with full concentration, you cannot afford to lose your productivity by whiling away you time, texting and chatting with your friends.</p>

<p>If you use Skype, Hangouts, MSN, Yahoo Messenger, then either sign out of them or disable notifications from these apps. Also, do not use the browser version of Gmail - hangouts is integrated in Gmail, so you would be much better off using IMAP or POP version of Gmail in your email client.</p>

<p>If switching your phone off is not an option, then you can either put it in Silent mode, or better still, turn off your data or the phone’s internet connectivity. If all these aren’t options to you, then you have to manually kill each “instant messaging” app (Like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, etc) by going to the App settings on your phone.</p>

<p>Doing this will help you spend less time socializing and will not hinder your productivity.</p>

<h2 id="c-manage-your-work-sessions">c. Manage your Work Sessions</h2>

<p>Despite not being related to technology, this tip is still worth a mention. If you tend to spend a lot of continuous hours in front of your computer, you become more stressed and this kills productivity.</p>

<p>For every hour you work, take a minimum of 10 minutes of break. Spend this 10 minutes either stretching, walking or just leaning back with your eyes closed.</p>

<p>Since I find it difficult to remember doing this every hour, I just ask Google to remind me. Just Google for “Google Set Timer” and set the time for One hour and leave the tab open.</p>

<p>It is also recommended that you have at least 6 to 7 hours of sleep every day, to maintain rational and clear thinking.</p>

<h2 id="d-play-the-right-music">d. Play the right music</h2>

<p><img src="http://img.techcovered.org/tc/video-game-music.png" alt="video-game-music" />If you plan to be ‘wired in’ to your computer, you might as well put on your headphones and listen to some motivational music tracks that really pump up your energy levels.</p>

<p>The music you choose for this, is also a factor which can affect your productivity. For instance, if you listen to music tracks with lyrics, they get stuck in your head and get repetitive and irritating to listen to. For long working hours, jazz music and classical music like Beethoven, Bach, Chopin, etc. are recommended.</p>

<p>Personally, I prefer listening to the sound track of video games. Some of these soundtracks are pleasant to listen to, and do not bring your attention from your work to the music track.</p>
