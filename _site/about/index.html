<p>Techcovered was founded as a technology blog, covering all aspects of technology (hence the name - Tech Covered). The website now revolves around how-to guides, tips and tricks to get things done easier, and also occasional articles on news and other trivial topics.</p>

<p>TechCovered was started on the month of July 2011, on Blogger (<a href="http://techcovered.blogspot.com/">the old website</a>) and is now shifted to the WordPress (self hosted) platform due to <a href="http://www.techcovered.org/5/techcovered-on-wordpress">several issues and benefits </a>of WordPress over Blogger.</p>
