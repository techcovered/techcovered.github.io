    <h1>Should you use Google+ Comments for Wordpress?</h1>
    <p class="muted">24 April 2013</p>
	<hr>
    <p>If your blogger blog is connected to your Google+ account, then you can enable Google+ comments for you blog. By doing so, all discussions of your blog posts on Google+, as well as your website will be integrated into your site comments. This is officially available only for blogger.</p>

<p>A WordPress developer has recently made a WordPress plugin, which will allow you to use Google+ comments for WordPress. You can download the plugin from the <a href="http://www.cloudhero.net/misc/gplus-comments.zip">developers website </a>or from <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/gplus-comments/">WordPress plugin directory</a>. You can also see it in action in the <a href="http://www.cloudhero.net/gplus-comments">developers blog</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://img.techcovered.org/tc/wordpress-g+.jpg" alt="wordpress-g+" /></p>

<p>The questions boils down to this - Should you use Google+ for WordPress? While the social integration with Google+ will be a huge plus for your website, the cons outweigh the pros. You should stick with your current commenting system, instead of migrating to Google+ commenting system.</p>

<p>Google+ comment’s biggest drawback is that it cannot be moderated. While all other commenting systems like disqus and even Facebook comments allow the web admin to moderate the comments, in Google+, you cannot simply do that in Google+ comments. If your website receives any negative criticism (which could also be baseless - as in case of the internet) in either Google plus or your blog itself, you cannot down vote or block such comments.</p>

<p>Among many other drawbacks, another con is that the web admin will not be able to view all the comments. Thats right - you cannot even look at all the things people have to say about your blog. In the <a href="http://support.google.com/blogger/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2981015">help page</a>, Google tells that blog authors will not be able to view comments which are not shared with the author - meaning, you cannot even read your contents comments (Now why would Google do that?)</p>

<p>There isn’t even a moderation page for your blog comments, which puts your blog comments out of control from the web admin (who would want that?).</p>

<p><em>[ However, there are some plus sides too. Google+ comments supports hashtags and tagging other profiles to it, apart from integrating everything on Google+ with your blog.It also loads up pretty fast. ]</em></p>

<p><a href="disqus.com">Disqus</a>, the most preferred commenting system, is the best alternate to the default WordPress comments. <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/">Facebook comments </a>is also a good option, if you want the one billion Facebook users to interact on your website. <a href="http://intensedebate.com/">IntenseDebate </a>is also a worthy alternative.</p>

<p>If you are a casual blogger, who wants something that is quick, eye pleasing, and just works - then Google+ comments maybe for you, else - stay away from it.</p>
