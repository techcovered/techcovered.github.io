    <h1>How to not Spoil your Laptop Battery through Continuous Charging</h1>
    <p class="muted">10 July 2013</p>
	<hr>
    <p>If you own a laptop, you would have experienced times when you would have continuously kept the laptop for charging for hours together, despite the battery reaching 100% charge capacity or being fully charged. Whether you know it or not, this is immensely dangerous for your laptop’s Lithium ion (Li-ion) battery and doing so frequently will affect your battery life permanently.</p>

<p><a href="http://img.techcovered.org/tc/battery-power.png"><img src="https://techcovered.github.io/images/battery-power_thumb.png" alt="battery-power" /></a></p>

<p>So what do you do to prevent this? The answer is simple. You should <strong>remove your laptop battery</strong> whenever you are <strong>connected to AC power</strong> source and plan on using it for long hours.</p>

<p>If you don’t already know, your laptop can work fine with AC source connected and with battery removed. But before you remove the battery, make sure that your laptop is shut down. Then remove battery, connect AC power source and then boot the laptop.</p>

<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Your laptop’s battery life will be greatly improved and will not be reduced.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can cool the laptop more efficiently. If any laptop gamers experience laptop overheating due to excessive gaming or CPU/GPU usage, then removing the battery and using AC source will help you.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="precautions">Precautions</h2>

<p>However, there are some precautions you must follow while doing this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Your laptop must be shut down first and the AC power source in order for you to remove the battery.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After removing the battery, it must be placed in a moist-free, sunlight-free, cool place. This is very important as the battery might be damaged otherwise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After removing the battery, the laptop is vulnerable to dust. Make sure you put your laptop down on a clean surface, free of dust, before you proceed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure the AC power source is stable. If the power goes when you are connected via AC source, the laptop then shuts down without any warning.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I have been trying this since the start of this week and I must admit, the laptop works just as fine with the AC power source as it did with the battery. Although during power outages, any work done would go unsaved, but that is a small cost, considering destroying your laptop’s battery life. They don’t come cheap these days.</p>
