    <h1>How to Delete Any Online Account of Yours</h1>
    <p class="muted">09 September 2014</p>
	<hr>
    <p>It is always much easier to register yourself on websites, than to delete yourself or deregister yourself. Unfortunately, only a very few websites on the internet actually allow you to delete your profile from their website. Thankfully, Facebook and Google are among those websites which let you delete your profile.</p>

<p>Skype, for example, has no direct link which you can visit, to delete your account. To delete your Skype account, you would have to chat with customer support and ask them to delete your account. iTunes also follows the same procedure: you first have to deactivate your account and then contact Apple to deactivate your iTunes account. There are  far more worse websites, like Buzz feed, CNN, Flipkart, Hacker News, where you cannot delete your account, once you create one.</p>

<p><img src="https://techcovered.github.io/images/pinterest-delete-account.jpg" alt="delete-account" /></p>

<p>This is where <a href="http://www.accountkiller.com/">Account Killer</a> is a god-send. This website isn’t a service which deletes account for you, but it provides a detailed description of how to delete your account, on a very wide range of websites. Websites have been divided into white list, blacklist and grey list, depending on how hard it is to delete your account on that website.</p>

<p>Account Killer also has a <a href="http://www.accountkiller.com/en/site-check">bookmarklet</a>, which lets you check how easy/hard it is to unregister yourself from a website, even before you register yourself.</p>

<p>In some cases, when you cannot delete your profile from a website, you should anonymise it. You should change your name, address, place, date of birth, etc to random strings or numbers so that the profile cant be linked back to you.</p>
