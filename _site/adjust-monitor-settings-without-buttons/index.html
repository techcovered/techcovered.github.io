    <h1>Adjust your Monitor Settings without its Physical Buttons</h1>
    <p class="muted">12 February 2014</p>
	<hr>
    <p>Lets assume you have an old monitor, with its physical buttons so overused, that it stops working. How then, will you change your monitor’s brightness, color contrast, RGB values, image position/width, etc? Luckily, there are a number of ways to do this.</p>

<p><a href="http://screenwhite.com/screenbright/">Screen Bright</a> is my favorite. The download is a small zip file and the application doesn’t even need an installation to run. You have sliders to change the brightness, contrast, color luminance, RGB values and even the warmth of the display (<a href="http://www.techcovered.org/341/best-way-to-use-computer-without-eye-strain">like Flux</a>). On running the file, all you need to do is to change the respective sliders to which ever value you like, as simple as that.</p>

<p>To change the screen resolution, an app is not needed, since Windows can do that for you. To change your resolution in Windows 7 and 8, right click, select Screen Resolution and change your resolution. If you still need an application to change your resolution for you, try <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/OS-Enhancements/Resolution-Changer.shtml">Display Changer</a> – it comes with a host of features such as using different resolutions when different applications are opened in Windows.</p>

<p>To change the screen orientation, nothing does it better than the display driver you have installed. For example, if you have an Intel chipset with no graphics card as such, this means that you have Intel’s integrated graphics. So, in order to change your monitors display settings such as screen orientation, you can change them through the drivers of your graphic card. I have an AMD graphics card and AMD’s driver (named Catalyst Control Center) offers a wide variety of tools to change your monitors settings. Similar features are also offered by nVidia’s control panel.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If some of these apps do not work for your monitor, make sure that you have enabled DDC/CI in your monitor. To do this, you have to (unfortunately) use the physical buttons itself. <img src="images/media-20140212.jpg" alt="media-20140212" /></p>

<p>The above picture is from <a href="http://www.techcovered.org/setup">my Dell monitor</a>. Many recent monitors have the ability to enable this option.</p>
