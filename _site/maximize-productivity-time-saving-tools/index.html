    <p><img src="http://img.techcovered.org/tc/facebook-blocked.png" alt="facebook-blocked" />It is very easy to get distracted when working on your computer. If you have a habit of constantly checking Facebook, Twitter or Reddit every few hours, then you bound to be much less productive than what you could potentially be. You could either put yourself under a rigid schedule and use your self control to limit yourself to the boundaries of your work, or you could take an easy path and use some tools which help you save your time.</p>

<p>When it comes to blocking websites, nobody does it better than <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en">StayFocusd</a>, a chrome extension. On installing, you can go to the extension’s settings page and give a complete list of websites you’d like to block. Alternatively, you can only give a list of websites which you wish to browse, and let this extension block the rest.</p>

<p>StayFocusd allows you to browse a blocked website for 10 minutes a day, which is rather useful if you actually need to access the blocked website for work purposes or a quickie. If you work on multiple devices, StayFocusd allows you to sync the settings and websites list from different devices with Chrome sync. You also have a “Nuke” option where you can mass-block a lot of websites for a given amount of time under the condition that you cannot unblock them within that given time.</p>

<p>For Firefox users, a similar add-on, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock/">LeechBlock</a> helps you block websites too. You can categorize the websites you wish to block under “sets” and also customize it a great deal. You can specify your custom error pages for different sets of blocked websites. You also can put a password to bypass the blockade, though it isn’t recommended as you would probably end up wasting time.</p>

<p>If you own a Mac, then <a href="http://selfcontrolapp.com/">Self Control </a>is a free, open-source Mac application which lets you block websites on your whole computer for a given time.</p>

<p>If you would like to see how much time you waste, here are a <a href="http://www.techcovered.org/478/apps-to-manage-time">few apps which lets you measure how much time you’re wasting everyday </a>doing things instead of being productive.</p>
