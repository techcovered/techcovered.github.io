    <h1>Free up disk space by deleting older System Restore Points</h1>
    <p class="muted">26 May 2013</p>
	<hr>
    <p>If you have an older computer with less storage space, then deleting the older system restore will probably help you save some valuable hard disk space. System restore points (on a single drive) can occupy, by default, as much as 5% of the drives total storage space.</p>

<p>You have many options when it comes to system restore. You can either allot only a few percentage (say 2%) to the system restore for each drive, or you can delete all your existing system restore points in order to save hard disk space.</p>

<h2 id="allot-less-space-to-system-restore">Allot less space to System Restore</h2>

<p>If you do not want to delete all your current system points for a rainy day, then a wise choice is to reduce the amount of space it uses. To do so, right click on the <em>Computer</em> icon in the desktop and select <em>Properties</em>. In the left side, click on the _System Protection. _Click on your drives in which protection is enabled (by default, it is the C drive) and select _Configure. _</p>

<p><img src="http://img.techcovered.org/tc/system-restore.png" alt="system-restore" /></p>

<p>In the dialog box, move the slider from the default value to somewhere around 2%. That is, only 2% of your space on that drive would be allotted for System Restore.</p>

<h2 id="disable-system-restore-on-other-drives">Disable System Restore on other drives</h2>

<p>Your computer doesn’t really need system restore on all the drives, so you can safely disable them on the other drives. In the same dialog (Right click <em>Computer</em>, select <em>Properties</em>, Select <em>System Protection</em>), select the drives other than the C drive and click on <em>Configure. _Select the _Turn off protection</em> for the drives.</p>

<h2 id="delete-selected-system-restore-points">Delete selected System Restore points</h2>

<p>You have two options here. You can delete all your system restore points (not recommended) or just delete a few selected ones.</p>

<p>To delete all the restore points, right click on <em>Computer</em>, select <em>Properties</em>. In the left side, click on <em>System Protection</em> and in the dialog box, select the drive with system restore turned on, and click on <em>configure</em>. Finally, click on the <em>Delete</em> button to delete all the restore points.</p>

<p>Another option (which is recommended) is to install the uber-useful tool called <a href="http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner">CCleaner</a> (heard of it?). This utility software is used to remove all useless and temporary files from your computer, but also comes with a registry cleaner, uninstaller, driver wiper, start-up manager and the now relevant System Restore Manager.</p>

<p><a href="http://img.techcovered.org/tc/ccleaner-system-restore.png"><img src="http://img.techcovered.org/tc/ccleaner-system-restore_thumb.png" alt="ccleaner-system-restore" /></a></p>

<p>Click on <em>Tools&gt;System Restore.</em> You will then find a list of all the current System Restore points residing in your system. Click on the ones you don’t want (I’d recommend everything; The first one is disabled by default for security reasons) and click on remove. That’s it! You are now left with only your latest system restore point.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can also use CCleaner to wipe off temporary files off your computers to fetch you more disk space. In my personal experience, having this program run every 2 months in my computer clears as much as 6 gigabytes of hard disk space (with all the install and uninstalling I do).</p>
