    <h1>Five Things You Never Knew Chrome Could do</h1>
    <p class="muted">08 December 2014</p>
	<hr>
    <p>Chrome is the most widely used browser today, and that too for a reason. It is very fast, highly stable, easy on the eye and has a ton of plugins to go with. One would think Chrome is just a simple browser. However, there are a lot of things Chrome can do.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the top 5 things you never knew chrome could do:</p>

<h2 id="pdf-reader">1. PDF Reader</h2>

<p>Chrome has an in built PDF reader, which lets you read and save PDFs from within Chrome. In fact, even if your computer doesn’t have a dedicated PDF reader (Adobe’s PDF reader is 45 MB), Chrome can serve as a fully functioning PDF reader.</p>

<p><img src="https://techcovered.github.io/images/chrome-pdf.png" alt="chrome-pdf" /></p>

<p>All you have to do is drag a PDF document from your computer and drop it on Chrome to open it in Chrome’s PDF viewer. This also works in other browsers which have their own PDF viewer, say Mozilla Firefox.</p>

<h2 id="music-player">2. Music Player</h2>

<p>Chrome can also play your music without you having to install any music player or media manager. A wide range of file formats are also supported.</p>

<p><img src="https://techcovered.github.io/images/chrome-music.png" alt="chrome-music" /></p>

<p>To play a music file in chrome, just drag and drop the file in Chrome and it’ll turn into a slick music player. The player is not a total replacement for an actual full featured music player, so use this as an alternative to play a music file in a hurry without having your media player installed.</p>

<p>If you want a fully featured media player within chrome (for some reason), there are a lot of extensions for Chrome, like <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remo-music-player/ajilpdcmebalpffmjjopcingplogifhb">Remo</a>.</p>

<h2 id="video-player">3. Video Player</h2>

<p><img src="https://techcovered.github.io/images/chrome-video.png" alt="chrome-video" /></p>

<p>Chrome also doubles up as a video player. It doesn’t support a large variety of videos, but the videos which it supports are rendered perfectly. Chrome can also handle very large size videos, including HD and Blu-ray and play them with ease. It also allows you to play videos in full screen, in case you feel weird watching a video in a tab.</p>

<h2 id="flash-player">4. Flash Player</h2>

<p><img src="https://techcovered.github.io/images/chrome-flash.png" alt="chrome-flash" /></p>

<p>Chrome is probably one of the few browsers which come pre-installed with its own Adobe Flash plugin. Though Flash is threatened with emerging adoption of HTML5, there are still plenty of sites which host flash content.</p>

<p>If you have a .swf file (or a flash file) or game, which you would like to run locally, Chrome can run it without needing you to install Adobe Flash player.</p>

<h2 id="calculator">5. Calculator</h2>

<p><img src="https://techcovered.github.io/images/chrome-calculator.png" alt="chrome-calculator" /></p>

<p>If you need to find what <em>122^(50/21)</em> equals, the simplest way to do this would be to use Chrome’s omnibox. Chrome also supports advanced mathematical expressions, like <em>sin 35 degrees/cos 42 degrees * log 20.9</em> , but don’t go all <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">wolframalpha</a> on Chrome, though.</p>
