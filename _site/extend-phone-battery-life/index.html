    <h1>How to Extend the Battery Life of your Phone</h1>
    <p class="muted">19 March 2013</p>
	<hr>
    <p>If you have ever left your phone charging all night, and woken up to a 100% charged phone, then you are at a risk of reducing the efficiency of your mobile phones battery life. Imagine your phone running out of juice, when you are far away from home, and cannot find a charging port! Nightmare.</p>

<p><img src="https://techcovered.github.io/images/phone-battery.jpg" alt="phone-battery-dead" /></p>

<p>You can extend the battery life of your phone by using these simple tips:</p>

<h2 id="use-a-battery-saving-app">1) Use a battery-saving app:</h2>

<p>If you use a smartphone (either Android,iOS,Blackberry,Windows Phone), then  you must use a battery-saver app. A battery-saver app usually manages all the tasks/processes of your phone, including network connections, WiFi, etc and automatically powers them down when not in use.</p>

<p>Some good apps for Android are <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.latedroid.juicedefender">Juice Defender</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easy.battery.saver">Easy Battery Saver</a>. For those with an iPhone, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/battery-doctor-battery-saver/id446751279?mt=8">Battery Doctor </a>is a well known app. Windows Phone users can opt for <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/battery-sense-free/d4818006-d50c-4cdd-aef2-b5c9290d6fd3">Battery Sense</a>, which has an very good user interface and provides lots of customization.</p>

<h2 id="disable-wifi-and-data-when-not-in-use">2) Disable WiFi and Data when not in use:</h2>

<p>It all boils down to this - if you are not using the internet, then it is ultra-wise to disable the WiFi or the Data on your phone. I have found that when either of them are turned on, the battery reduces dramatically, than compared with them turned off.</p>

<p>This is more of a common sense tip, which will end you saving loads of battery power.</p>

<h2 id="use-battery-notification-apps-to-prevent-overcharging">3) Use battery notification apps to prevent overcharging:</h2>

<p>It is no secret that continuously charging your phone, even after it has reached 100%, will reduce the battery efficiency. We have all, at times, left our phones plugged to the charger for a long time, and completely forgot about it.</p>

<p>Apps come to the rescue here (again). My personal favorite is the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pextor.batterychargeralarm">Battery Full Alarm</a> app for Android which notifies you when your phone is fully charged, and also provides a theft-alarm in case someone tried to unplug your phone - which is useful when you use public locations to charge your phone. For  iPhone, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/battery-doctor-battery-saver/id446751279?mt=8">Battery Doctor </a> provides. Windows Phone users can use <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/battery-sense-free/d4818006-d50c-4cdd-aef2-b5c9290d6fd3">Battery Sense</a> to do the same.</p>

<h2 id="follow-the-discharge-cycle">4) Follow the Discharge Cycle:</h2>

<p>A not-so-well known tip to improve your current battery life is to follow the discharge cycle (or charging cycle) for your phone. The discharge cycle is easy to follow. However, to start this cycle, you should completely discharge your phone and make sure your phone gets switched down automatically due to low battery.</p>

<p>Then, charge the phone (switched off) for as much as 4-5 hours (depending on the average time your phone requires to fully charge. When the battery reaches 100%, remove the charger, and use your phone normally - until the battery gets completely used and repeat this cycle for about 3-4 times. Your battery life will improve admirably.</p>

<p>Doing this at least once a month is recommended. (Even Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/batteries/iphone.html">recommends </a>this - Trust Apple, guys)</p>

<h2 id="keeping-the-phone-at-optimal-temperature">5) Keeping the phone at optimal temperature:</h2>

<p>If you have the habit of keeping your phone in the window pane, under direct sunlight, then as your phone gets heated up, the battery is sure to drain quickly. Many phone manufactures recommend this, including <a href="http://www.apple.com/batteries/iphone.html">Apple</a>.Also try to keep your phone in a separate bag instead of your pocket whenever possible, to avoid body temperature affecting your battery life.</p>

<h2 id="just-buy-a-new-battery">6) Just buy a new battery:</h2>

<p>It comes to the more obvious now. If your battery isn’t even the shadow of what it used to be, then you should consider buying a battery for your phone. Apple iPhone batteries usually cost someone around $6-$7, and can be bought cheaply from <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/GENUINE-iPhone-Battery-ORIGINAL-Internal/dp/B007RF8D5U">Amazon</a>, etc. The same also applies for phones of other manufacturers.</p>

<p>But make sure that the new battery replacement is original, and intended for use for your particular phone.</p>
