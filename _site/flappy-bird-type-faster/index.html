    <p>Flappy Bird, the former #1 game in the App store and the Play store (before being removed from the stores by its author for some unknown reasons), is an immensely addictive and extremely difficult game. In fact, the game is so tough, my high score is 10. </p>

<p>Another coder, by the name of “Mr. Speaker”, has stolen the design ideas of flappy bird, to create a game exactly like flappy bird, online. However, unlike the actual mobile game, you have to constantly type the letters of a given word, to keep the flappy bird in flight.</p>

<p>The game, as you might have guessed, is exceedingly difficult and was almost next to impossible for me to score beyond a 3. However, looking on the bright side, this game brings flappy bird to your browser. This game was written in JavaScript and on inspection of the code on the website, you can get access to the game files: the author has not encrypted/obfuscated the code for some reasons.</p>

<p>Flappy bird, meanwhile, has become an internet sensation, with many people pleading the developer to put the app back on the store and also to deliver “Flappy Bird 2”. There are many “Flappy Bird Technique” videos on the internet, of which this video deserves the cake.</p>
