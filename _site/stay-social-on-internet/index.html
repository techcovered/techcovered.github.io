    <h1>How to Stay Social on the Internet</h1>
    <p class="muted">08 February 2014</p>
	<hr>
    <p>Regardless of your real life social life, it is always a bit tough to remain actively social on the internet. From constant twitter updates, Facebook status updates, instagram photos, blog updates/comment responses, you might find yourself juggling the online and offline lives.</p>

<p>Here is a short guide to a list of web apps and tips to help you lead an active social life on the internet.</p>

<h3 id="schedule-your-status-updates">1. Schedule your status updates</h3>

<p>If you need to be social, your status updates must be regular like a clockwork. If you are the manager of your company’s online presence, then the need to be always online is essential. Thankfully, you don’t need to always be online to do this. The are many web services which lets you do this for free.</p>

<p><img src="http://img.techcovered.org/tc/bufferapp.png" alt="bufferapp" /></p>

<p><a href="https://hootsuite.com">HootSuite</a> tops it all, by offering a very large range of tools dedicated to allow you to vastly control your social structure online. It also provides scheduling tools through which you can post to multiple profiles on different social networks. Another worthy alternative is <a href="https://bufferapp.com">Buffer</a>, which has an interface more pleasing to the eye. Buffer also provides analytics to the updates you post, though its accuracy is debatable. If you need a more simpler interface, <a href="laterbro.com">LaterBro</a> does a very good job. However, scheduling posts only to Facebook and Twitter is allowed.</p>

<h3 id="use-ifttt-to-link-multiple-profiles">2. Use IFTTT to link multiple profiles</h3>

<p>You may have many profiles over various social networks, which is a good thing. However, if you need to update them all, you would have to spend lots of time updating each and everyone one of them. However, if you use <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> to link your various profiles from different social networks (assuming you have one profile per network), then posting to one networking site is enough.</p>

<p>Here are a few recipes which you can use to link your profiles.</p>

<h3 id="use-email-auto-responders">3. Use email auto responders</h3>

<p>Instant replies to people who send you email, makes all the difference between a person who is socially active online and one who is not. Regardless of whether you are online or not, you can still reply to new emails. To do this, you can set up auto responders.</p>

<p><img src="http://img.techcovered.org/tc/gmail_vacation.png" alt="gmail_vacation" /></p>

<p>Gmail has its own email responder built-in, it goes by the name of <em>Vacation responder</em>. If you use outlook to manage your emails, you can use it to send auto replies too (Tutorials: <a href="http://staff.ask.sydney.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/496">link 1</a>, <a href="http://answers.uchicago.edu/page.php?id=27432">link 2</a>). If you use outlook.com, you can use outlook’s auto responder too (Gear icon&gt;More mail settings&gt; Sending automated vacation replies). So, the next time when a (possible) fan sends out an email to you, be sure you get back to him/her instantly.</p>

<h3 id="personal-response">4. Personal response</h3>

<p>There is absolutely no substitute for a personal responses to email, tweets, blog comments, etc. So no matter how lazy you might be, a secret to being social is to frequently respond to tweets, emails addressed to you – even though they are generalized and not intended for you personally. If you maintain a blog, the comments sections is one of the most important, yet undertreated, aspect of your blog. Regularly responding to comments also ups the author-reader relation, eventually improving your blogs/websites ratings/pageviews.</p>

<p>Did I miss out on anything? If yes, do send me an email (<a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#097;&#098;&#104;&#105;&#108;&#097;&#115;&#104;&#064;&#116;&#101;&#099;&#104;&#099;&#111;&#118;&#101;&#114;&#101;&#100;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#097;&#098;&#104;&#105;&#108;&#097;&#115;&#104;&#064;&#116;&#101;&#099;&#104;&#099;&#111;&#118;&#101;&#114;&#101;&#100;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>) or just a <a href="twitter.com/thatabhi">tweet</a>.</p>
