    <h1>OneNote is the best Evernote Alternative yet</h1>
    <p class="muted">30 March 2014</p>
	<hr>
    <p>When it comes to note taking, Evernote has so far been the granddaddy of them all. Even though it comes with a limited bandwidth of a measly 60 MB for free users, its features and compatibility on all devices, including a web version, makes it a note taking service worth using. However, there’s another competitor on the block – Microsoft OneNote.</p>

<p><img src="images/onenote.png" alt="onenote" /></p>

<p>Microsoft hasn’t exactly been on an innovation spree since the past few months, but one thing you can expect from them is their ability to give you a robust and solid Office suite, which is currently the best in class. OneNote, being a part of the office suit, is built in similar terms. Despite being around since 2003, it remained as the underdog, while its competitors like Evernote flourished.</p>

<p>So what brings OneNote back to attention now? Microsoft has just released OneNote for free – on all devices. This means that OneNote is available for download on <a href="http://www.onenote.com/Download">Windows PC</a>, <a href="http://www.onenote.com/WindowsPhone">Windows Phone</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.onenote&amp;hl=en-us">Android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/microsoft-onenote/id410395246?mt=8">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-onenote-for-ipad/id478105721?mt=8">iPad</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-onenote/id784801555?mt=12">Mac</a>. There is also an <a href="http://www.onenote.com/notebooks">online version available</a>. If you reply on Evernote’s web clipper, there is also a <a href="https://www.onenote.com/Clipper/OneNote">web clipper bookmarklet</a> for OneNote.</p>

<h3 id="where-onenote-wins">Where OneNote Wins</h3>

<p><img src="images/onedrive_storage.png" alt="onedrive_storage" />Coming from the family of unbeatable office apps, OneNote is hands down the best digital note taking app I’ve ever laid my hands on. With its click-anywhere-to-edit (not available on the Mac for some unknown reason), it does an excellent job. Think of OneNote as not just a service which stores your notes, but as method in which you take notes. My philosophy apart, OneNote easily beats Evernote in note editing.</p>

<p>OneNote is also integrated deeply with OneDrive, which means it does not have any limits on which a note can be synced and how large a notebook can be. Evernote offers 60 MB bandwidth for free users, whereas paid users get 1 GB of bandwidth and a maximum of 100 MB per note. OneNote has no such limit, and entirely depends on the free available storage on your OneDrive account.</p>

<h3 id="where-evernote-wins">Where Evernote Wins</h3>

<p><a href="http://img.techcovered.org/tc/evernote_android.jpg"><img src="images/evernote_android_thumb.jpg" alt="evernote_android" /></a>Evernote has been the market leader since long and has a huge fan base community who swear by evernote. While OneNote has a lot of features, Evernote is even better. The premium version of Evernote comes with search function which can search for content within your images, pdf documents, etc.</p>

<p>Evernote also comes with better security – with the option of enabling password protection in every note while OneNote offers password for only the whole notebook.</p>

<p>Evernote also has better apps when it comes to mobile and tablets. While Microsoft is still on its way to provide optimal interface for mobile note-taking, Evernote has been there and done that already.</p>

<h3 id="which-one-really-wins">Which one really wins?</h3>

<p>The answer to the question really depends on what you are looking for. If you want a note-taking app, which has tons of storage available, with an awe inspiring desktop note taking editor, and do not mind the ok-ish app, then OneNote is for you.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you prefer a note-taking app with a lot of extra functionality like (obsessive) searching features, extra password protection, better apps for mobile devices, and do not mind the less storage space and syncing capability, then Evernote is for you.</p>

<p>If you really can’t decide which one to go for, then why not both?</p>

<p><img src="images/why_not_both.jpg" alt="why_not_both" /></p>

<p>Apart from these heavyweights, there are many other note taking apps, like <a href="http://keep.google.com">Google Keep</a> (lightweight and online based), <a href="http://springpad.com">Springpad</a> (very promising), etc to name a few. Which one do you use? Do comment.</p>
