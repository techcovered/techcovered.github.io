    <h1>How to Properly Research Before Buying Anything Online</h1>
    <p class="muted">25 August 2013</p>
	<hr>
    <p>Everyone loves buying things. But most people out there do so without proper research and in the end, they often end up regretting buying it and not something else, with the money spent. Whether it is a toaster, washing machine, tablet, mobile phone, laptop or even any computer component, a proper research is required before you buy it.</p>

<p>So how do you do a “proper” research? Are there any steps, methods or instructions to follow while researching? To the inexperienced mind, there is a number of steps you should follow to conduct a proper research on the product you are buying.</p>

<h2 id="which-one-are-you-exactly-buying">1. Which one are you exactly buying?</h2>

<p>You may not know this, but many products are named so closely. Take for example the NVidia graphics card GTX 650, which has another very closely named brother – the GTX 650Ti which, despite being only different in two characters name wise, manages to outwit the other in terms of performance by a <a href="http://www.hwcompare.com/13623/geforce-gtx-650-vs-geforce-gtx-650-ti/">large amount</a>. The same might also exist for the product you are buying. If you want to buy something, make sure you have the right one. If you aren’t sure, use Google or Google’s <a href="http://www.google.com/imghp">Image Search</a> to be sure.</p>

<h2 id="watch-the-hands-on-and-unboxing-videos">2. Watch the hands-on and unboxing videos</h2>

<p><img src="https://techcovered.github.io/images/xolo-youtube.png" alt="xolo-youtube" />YouTube is THE source when it comes to product reviews and comparison videos. Before you bite the bullet and buy something, it is recommended you look up the “hands on” review of the product on YouTube. If you are searching for a mobile phone, you can be best assured that there is a video review about it somewhere. Not only are phones, tablets, laptops, etc covered, you also get <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdJboKfYFFw">many(1)</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHqdZ9LDzK4">many(2)</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq6d6zla27M">many(3)</a> reviews of other stuff too.</p>

<p>Generally, the hands on videos and unboxing videos are more preferred, compared to the review videos, which is basically other peoples opinion on it, on which you shouldn’t pay much attention.</p>

<h2 id="compare-the-technical-parts">3. Compare the technical parts</h2>

<p>As a rule of the thumb, when researching for a product, you should always have an alternate product in mind to which you constantly compare your product of interest. Before deciding on which one to buy, you should look at the technical (hardware and software) part of the product and compare it with the other product. Usually, a Google search like “<your product="" name=""> specifications” is the best way to do it. However, you can even use shopping sites like [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Google-Nexus-Tablet-7-Inch-Black/dp/B00DVFLJDS/) to give you the technical details of it.</your></p>

<p>There are many websites that also compare stuff. For example, this site compares phones, tablets, laptops, and a lot more, while other sites like <a href="http://cpuboss.com">this</a> and <a href="http://gpuboss.com">this</a> are more specific in their purposes. <img src="https://techcovered.github.io/images/s4-vs-iphone5.png" alt="s4-vs-iphone5" /></p>

<h2 id="read-the-all-important-reviews">4. Read the all important reviews.</h2>

<p><img src="https://techcovered.github.io/images/amazon-nexus4.png" alt="amazon-nexus4" />By the above mentioned steps, you must have at least formed up an opinion on which product you see yourself buying. To seal (or even break) the deal, you must read the reviews of the product. Now that I have mentioned it, there are two kinds of reviews – one, by professionals who know what they are doing, and the other by people like you who have bought the product and are sharing their opinion with you.</p>

<p>The first kind of reviews can be found on professional sites. If it is a technology product, engadget would have likely covered it. For others, all you need is a Google search.</p>

<p>For the second kind of reviews, turn your head no further, because you will find them on shopping sites, in the “Customer Reviews” section.</p>
