    <h1>How to Secure Your Devices After They Have Been Stolen</h1>
    <p class="muted">02 August 2013</p>
	<hr>
    <p>Have you ever thought what you’d do when you lose any one of your devices like Laptop, Mobile Phone, Tablet or even desktop? You could report it to your nearest police station or local law enforcement. While that would take a lot of time, how would you like to know where your stolen device is currently and how would you like to see what the thief is doing with your device right now and secure your data? There’s an app for that.</p>

<p>Prey is an open source anti-theft application for almost all your devices, including Windows, Mac, Ubuntu, Linux, Android and iOS (No word on when the Windows Phone or Blackberry version is out).This app lets you remote control your device, automatically providing you the location of your device and screenshots of your device. As mentioned earlier, you can also remotely secure your data.</p>

<p><img src="http://img.techcovered.org/tc/prey-features.png" alt="prey-features" /></p>

<p>As soon as you download it and install it to your device, laptop or mobile or anything, you must create an account with prey. Once you did so, you will have to configure your device, like changing the frequency in which Prey runs, automatically connecting to an open Wi-Fi etc. To control the device, you will have to go to Prey’s Control Panel.</p>

<p>When your device is missing, just log in to the control panel and change your device’s status to missing. From that moment on, you will get frequent reports (depending on your devices settings) on the location of the system, screenshots, webcam pictures,  network information, all the files modified on your device etc. If you have a mobile phone, it also alerts you whenever the SIM card has been changed. It will also automatically force enable your phones Wi-Fi and mobile data, just to send you the device reports.</p>

<p>The best part of the the software is that consumes a very less amount of resources. For example, when it isn’t reporting anything, its service takes up only 4MB of memory, which is pretty impressive.</p>
