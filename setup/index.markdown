### Hardware:


I mainly use my self-assembled desktop for blogging purposes. The build consists of an 8 core AMD FX 8350, coupled with an Sapphire Radeon HD 7770 Ghz edition. The system has 8 GB of RAM and 1 TB of storage space. Two extra cabinet coolers are also being used for heat dissipation. I use a 21' Dell S2240L 1080p monitor, which I am in love with. For typing, I use a generic Dell keyboard and a standard HP mouse.

I also use my gateway NE56R laptop, occasionally, for blogging outside in the free air, which helps me think. I also own a Karbonn tablet, which I use sometimes to search for blog-fodder or browsing news.


### Software:


This blog runs on ~~self hosted wordpress~~ GitHub hosted Jekyll.

I use gedit with Markdown highlighting for creating and editing posts. I usually use Linux [Distro: Fedora 21] as my OS when updating the blog, but I also use Github's online editing tool when I am too lazy to switch from Windows.

For coding purposes, I use Firefox with the [firebug extension](getfirebug.com). I have a terrible crush on Sublime Text 2 and 3 and at times, I just open the editor for no reason, just to gawk at its majesty and then blush. I also use vi, but not for HTML, CSS or JS coding.

VLC Media player remains the media player of my choice for videos and Foobar for Windows is the music player of my choice.


### Mobile phone:


I used to earlier own a [Xolo A700](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/xolo-a700-769)Â but have now shifted over to the (awesome) [Gionee Elife E7](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/gionee-elife-e7-1141). It runs on Android ~~Jellybean 4.2.2~~ Kitkat 4.4 and houses a Snapdragon 800 quad core CPU, along with 2 GB of RAM. The device has become my hub for updating myself with feeds, podcast, news and social networking.

I also own a Kindle, which I find as an indispensable device I use to read ebooks, as well as the large "walls" of text I encounter on the internet, which I send to my kindle using the (awesome, again) [Kindle Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/send-to-kindle-for-google/cgdjpilhipecahhcilnafpblkieebhea).
