### Hardware:


I mainly use my self-assembled desktop for blogging purposes. The build consists of an 8 core AMD FX 8350, coupled with an Sapphire Radeon HD 7770 Ghz edition. The system has 8 GB of RAM and 1 TB of storage space. Two extra cabinet coolers are also being used for heat dissipation. I use a 21' Dell S2240L 1080p monitor, which I am in love with. For typing, I use a generic Dell keyboard and a standard HP mouse.

I also use my gateway NE56R laptop, occasionally, for blogging outside in the free air, which helps me think. I also own a Karbonn tablet, which I use sometimes to search for blog-fodder or browsing news.


### Software:


This blog runs on self hosted wordpress.

For blogging, I use [Windows Live Writer](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8621), which I find is the best desktop blog editor there is. For image editing purposes, I use the free [paint.net](http://www.getpaint.net/), which I find to be sufficient and intensively useful for quick editing. I use Windows 7, instead of the new Windows 8 or 8.1 as I can't seem to be getting much used to the new interface change.

For coding purposes, I use Firefox with the [firebug extension](getfirebug.com). I also use Notepad++ for editing purposes (they have a very impressive syntax highlighter).

VLC Media player remains the media player of my choice for videos, where Winamp has newly invaded my PC and is now my default audio player (Thank god it is not dead).


### Mobile phone:


I used to earlier own a [Xolo A700](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/xolo-a700-769)Â but have now shifted over to the (awesome) [Gionee Elife E7](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/gionee-elife-e7-1141). It runs on Android Jellybean 4.2.2 and houses a Snapdragon 800 quad core CPU, along with 2 GB of RAM. The device has become my hub for updating myself with feeds, podcast, news and social networking.

I also own a Kindle, which I find as an indispensable device I use to read ebooks, as well as the large "walls" of text I encounter on the internet, which I send to my kindle using the (awesome, again) [Kindle Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/send-to-kindle-for-google/cgdjpilhipecahhcilnafpblkieebhea).
