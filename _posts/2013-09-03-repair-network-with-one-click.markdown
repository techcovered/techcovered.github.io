When I was looking up how to solve a very particular problem regarding my network and Internet connectivity, I stumbled across this very awesome tool – the Repair Network tool, from [Shane’s Toolbox](http://www.pcwintech.com/shanes-toolbox). Do note that I am in no way advertising this product, but just advocating it because of my experience with it.

The app is very simple to begin with. It needs to be extracted first and all you have to do is to open the file and click on the “Start” button.  To serious developers and computer nerds, the tool doesn’t do much rather than execute some simple networking commands, which you could also type in command prompt and get the job done.

However, this app stands out because it does all this with a simple button click. I have had this on my computer for a week now, and whenever there is a slightest of a problem with the internet, till tool has managed to clear it up within seconds.

There are also many other simple tools on the website, like a tool which lets you detect the number of routers in your network, or the number of firewalls, etc, all of which can be downloaded from **[here](http://www.pcwintech.com/shanes-toolbox)**.
