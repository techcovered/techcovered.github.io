YouTube continues to have many interface changes, often changing lots of functionality associated with the site. While most of the changes are often very good, the recent change, however, which changes the way the spacebar and mouse pauses the video, comes as an irritant for many YouTube users who are, over the years, adjusted to it.

In the recent changes:
a)  If you click on a video to pause it, and then proceed to click it again to play it, YouTube automatically puts the player in full screen.
b) If the YouTube player is in focus, pressing the spacebar will pause the video, pressing it again will resume playing it. However, if you are in the comments section, pressing the spacebar is of no use.

## Use the J K L buttons


A lot of trouble and frustration on YouTube can easily be solved by the three *secret* shortcut buttons. These are the J,K and L buttons on your keyboard. I call them secret because no where in YouTube help documents are the buttons mentioned. Here are there functionalities:



	
  * J – Pressing this button will rewind the video back by 10 seconds.

	
  * K – Pressing this button will pause the video

	
  * L – Pressing this button will fast forward the video by 10 seconds.


The K button, most importantly, has changed my YouTube experience the most. The awesomeness of this button comes from the fact this button pauses the video, no matter which part of the page you are in.


## Some other useful shortcuts


YouTube also has a few other well known shortcuts:



	
  * F – Plays the video in full screen (But doesn’t work like the K button)

	
  * 0 – Plays video from the beginning (Not the number pad 0)

	
  * 1 to 9 – Plays the video from 10% to 90% seek (Again, the numbers are not from the number pad)

	
  * Tab – Focus on the YouTube player and select Tab to change various options of the player with the keyboard itself.
