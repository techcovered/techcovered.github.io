If you ever wanted to memorize something, you would probably read and re-read the given material a couple of times till you capable of remembering it fluently. However, this is not the most efficient way to learn. Study shows that you may forget as much as 75% of what you read, within hours after memorizing it.

Spaced repetition is a technique in which you use flash cards to memorize. These cards are displayed one after another, while you categorize each of the cards as easy, medium or tough to memorize. Depending on the difficulty of each card, they re-appear time after time, so that eventually, you don't forget anything.

[Anki ](http://ankisrs.net/)is an open source software, available for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS and (even) Blackberry. The software is a little bit confusing to use for the inexperienced. Anki allows you to create a "deck" of cards (which is basically a collection of cards) and allows you to create sub-decks, or deck within decks.

You can also study cards of the same topic, by moving them under the same deck, or better - moving decks under a single parent deck. Anki also has a [web version](https://ankiweb.net/), where you don't even need to install the software to your computer.

Anki works on the technique of spaced repetition, where you grade flash cards as "again", "good" or "easy", depending on whether the cards are tough, average or easy to memorize. Depending on what you select, the cards will be shown again after a fixed interval.

Anki also hasÂ  hugely popular mobile apps for [Android ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki)and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ankisrs/id373493387?mt=8), thorough which you can study more conveniently on your mobile phone or tablet. The mobile app syncs with the web version of Anki, which means you can create cards on the web version, and have the same cards displayed on your phone.

If Anki doesn't fit your needs for some reason, there are plenty alternates. Some of the notable ones are [Mnemo-Syne](http://mnemosyne-proj.org/download-mnemosyne.php) (also has an android app and a desktop client), [Studydroid ](http://studydroid.com/)( a web based alternate), the much simpler [OpenCards ](http://opencards.info/)(which works like a ppt slideshow).

If you are more interested in the various mobile apps which do the same, apps like [Chegg Flashcards](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id495398975), [StudyBlue](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id323887414?mt=8), [Flash Cards Deluxe ](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id307840670)are recommended for iOS. Very strangely, there is an [entire website ](http://www.flashcardapps.info/)dedicated to iOS flashcard apps. For android, [Flash Card deluxe ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orangeorapple.flashcards), [Flashcards+](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.allen.flashcardsfree) and [StudyBlue](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.studyblue) are recommended.
