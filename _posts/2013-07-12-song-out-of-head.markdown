Have you listened to some song unintentionally and got it stuck in your head all day (or even maybe all week)? This may, for example, happen when you are in a public transport and a person sitting nearby plays the song out loud, or when you accidentally continuously repeat a song in your playlist and sleep listening to the audio again and again. ([Also take Dexter’s example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vqWVHnDAMk#t=25))

Usually giving some time will erase the song from your memory, but if you really want that song to go out of your head, there are some ways to do that.


## a) Listen to similar addictive songs


When you have a song that keeps repeating in your head, listening to another similar song, of more or less the same tune or same artist, will most likely get that song out of your head. There are a [lot of services that help you find similar music](http://www.techcovered.org/237/find-similar-music). For example, Lady Gaga’s “Bad Romance” is similar to her “Poker Face”. So if you get any one of those stuck in your head, listen to the other a couple of times will do the trick.


## b) Listen to random addictive songs


If listening to similar songs isn’t helping, try listening to other songs which are likely to be stuck in your head. [Unhear it](http://unhearit.com/) is a one of a kind website that plays random songs, which are addictive and can easily get stuck in your head. If you already have a song stuck in your head, use this website to get it out. It uses sound tracks from [Sound Cloud](https://soundcloud.com/), which you can also browse for some user generated tracks.


## c) Do something else: Play a game or work out a bit


Sometimes I wonder why I even post articles which aren’t technical. So lets get to it straight: To lose a song, you have to indulge yourself in something which can take your attention for some time. This is researched somewhere, I can assure you (though I am unable to find the source).

Playing a computer game can immerse your concentration, and when you do finish your gaming session, it might be hard to even recall that song you were singing moments ago. The same applies with any physical activity such as working out.

Did these steps help you in forgetting that song? Do you know any other method to get that song out? Do comment!
