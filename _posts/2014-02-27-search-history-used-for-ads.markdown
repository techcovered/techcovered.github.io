Have you ever noticed how some ads are creepily the same as your search history? For example, if you browse for a product on a shopping site, then you can see some ads related to what you have seen on the shopping site, displayed everywhere on the internet. Recently, this is starting to show even on Facebook. How does this happen? Are they even related?

A while back, I had written about how [websites seem to share information with ad servers](http://www.techcovered.org/404/websites-share-information-with-google-ads). I had also mentioned that this happens through cookie exchanges taking place in the browser. While this gets only the basic facts right, there seems to be a much more complicated backend running all this.

Let me put this as simple as possible. When you view websites, (for example, shopping sites, ticket booking sites, etc.) they put a cookie in your browser, which a certain serial number attached to it. The website then traces all the pages you have visited on their site, and then provides this information to an ad company, along with how much they are willing to spend to show ads to this user. This ad company (called a “Demand Side Platform” or DSP) acts an intermediary between the website and the platform where you are shown the ad. This DSP then approaches various platforms such as Facebook, Google’s Advertising network,etc and bids on how much money they would pay to show the user the ads from the website.

These platforms, similarly, receive such bids from the different DSPs out there, and will automatically choose the highest paying bidder. Thus, the ads of the highest paying bidder is displayed on your screen. All this process is so fast, it happens in a matter of seconds. However, it is not _that_ fast and this ad is usually the slowest element of the website that’s loading.

But what happens if you *accidentally* browse for lingerie with hot models posing in them? Tough luck, because they are going to be displayed as ads anyway. However, if you use private browsing (or incognito on chrome) while browsing shopping sites, or clear your cookies/cache/history after your shopping spree, you can just about avoid this.

Another option is to opt-out of these DSPs, which seems like an almost impossible thing to do – because there are _so many_ DSPs and you don’t have a direct interaction with them, so you couldn’t possibly know which DSP is serving your ad. Here are some opt out pages of leading networks – [Network Advertising](https://www.quantcast.com/fbx-opt-out) and [Quantacast](https://www.quantcast.com/fbx-opt-out).
