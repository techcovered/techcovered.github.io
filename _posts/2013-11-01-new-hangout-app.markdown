Nexus 5 was released today and has the potential to be a huge success. Android 4.4, aka, KitKat was also launched simultaneously. Among many other improvement to UI and performance, a major change was the lack of a messaging app in KitKat. Instead, all your messages are sent with the Hangouts app from KitKat.

As you would have guessed, the Hangouts app is the default messaging app for all the future versions of Android. Before getting upset about this, like I initially did, I would suggest you to try out the app.

As soon as you launch the app, you are asked whether you would like to turn on SMS. On selecting yes, you are then directed to the SMS settings screen where you can customize your notification settings, MMS settings, etc.

When it comes to texting through Hangouts, I found out that Hangouts was pretty fast and almost non-laggy when it came to sending messages. Compared to the very slow Facebook Messenger, Hangouts scores pretty well. Another plus point is that Hangouts has a much better UI than the basic looks of that of the stock messaging app.

The Hangouts app available in the [play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.talk) still hasn’t been updated with the new feature. However, you can download the Hangouts app extracted from Android KitKat from [here](http://www.androidfilehost.com/?fid=23203820527944613) (courtesy [Android Police](http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/10/31/apk-download-hangouts-1-3-support-sms-animated-gifs-location-sharing/)).
