Here is something which a few of us know about – Google provides you unlimited storage space for images and videos, for free! To do this, all you need is a Google account, a ton of images and a Google+ profile.

**[Google+ photos](https://plus.google.com/photos)** is a part of (any guesses?) Google+ and it stores all the images you ever uploaded on the networking site. However, Google+ Photos is more useful than it looks like. Why? Because it allows you to store photos which are lesser than 2048x2048 resolution and videos under 15 minutes, without taking up any of your space in the Google-allotted 15 GB. This means, you can store an unlimited number of images and <15 minute videos for free, without taxing any of your space on Google!

The images you upload on Google+ Photos are by default “not shared”, which means that they are only visible to you. You can use this to upload all of your pictures and not worry about it being visible to your Google+ friends or .. err.. circle mates.

However, the only catch is that your image size needs to be less than or equal to 2048x2048 resolution. While this may be a turn off to people who are serious about their photos retaining their original resolution, the bargain of unlimited storage space vs above-average resolution is too good to turn away. Besides, 2048x2048 images are of the 2K resolution, which has twice the pixels present in a Full HD (1080p) display. However, if you need some images to retain their original resolution, you can upload them as is, but they will take up space on your Google account, while they smaller resolution ones are free.

To automatically upload photos at original size, you need to tick the “Upload my photos at full size” in [Google+ Settings](https://plus.google.com/settings?hl=en).

If your images are well above the 2048 resolution, you need to resize them accordingly. You can do this easily with freeware tools like [paint.net](http://getpaint.net), [gimp](http://www.gimp.org/), [irfanview](http://www.irfanview.com/), etc. If you have a lot of images which need to be resized, you need to batch process them. You can you irfanview to do this, or use a [lightning image resizer](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Others/Lightning-Image-Resizer.shtml) to do it for you. Do keep in mind that the maximum width and height should be 2048 pixels.

Do note that this storage is different from the other parts of Google’s storage like Gmail or Google Drive, and the photos you upload wont be accessible by any other Google service. Also, Google+ Photos has its own apps for [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google%20-photos/efjnaogkjbogokcnohkmnjdojkikgobo) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.plus).
