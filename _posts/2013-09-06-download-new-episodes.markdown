If you love watching sitcoms and cannot afford to miss out on even one episode, there is a simple way to automatically download episodes to your computer via torrent and watch them when you have free time.

[**ShowRSS**](http://showrss.karmorra.info) is a website in which you select your favorite sitcoms and then, the website automatically generates a list of episodes which are available. The website then generates a personalized RSS link for you, which you can enter in your Torrent’s feed subscriber (like uTorrent, etc). Your torrent client will automatically download these episodes for you.

To start with, you should create an id in the site (your email address is not required; how very kind of them). The next step is to pick your list of sitcoms. As you chose the sitcoms available in the list, the episodes list keep building. Then, click the “Feeds” on the top navigation bar and in the “Your feed address:” select the quality of the episode that you want and then click “Generate”. Copy the link of the RSS feed.

In your torrent client, like uTorrent or Bit torrent, click on File>Add RSS Feed. Paste the RSS feed link you just copied and click ok. All your episodes will begin downloading now. The more the number of episodes, the slower they download.

**Disclaimer:** This is an informative post. Do note that downloading of any copyrighted material is illegal and any problems with the law caused due to this, will not hold this site or its author responsible.

For all of you wondering how the feeds automatically download the episodes, it is because the feeds attach themselves to a “.torrent” as a media file(in RSS protocol), which the torrent client reads and download the episode. Download responsibly.
