Firefox has slowly become a browser that is slow and bulky, to something that is slim and well, -almost- snappy. But what if Firefox starts to slow down? Or what if someone downloaded a lot of unwanted toolbars and set options so that you could never change your homepage at all? Re-installing Firefox could be one way to solve this problem. The other way is much simpler - reset Firefox.

To reset Firefox, type **about:support **in the URL "Awesome" bar. Then click on the "**Reset Firefox**" Button to reset Firefox to its default settings. Firefox will now return to its factory build, but however, it retains your bookmarks, passwords that you saved, cookies and even your browsing history.




All toolbars and extensions/themes are removed from Firefox, so do remember to make a list of extensions that are useful to you so that you can reinstall them.




If, by some case, you want to undo the factory reset, all you have to do is copy some old profile data to another. To do this, open Windows Explorer and type **%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\ **in the navigation bar. Copy all the files/folders in "Old Firefox data" to the other folder.




Note: For plugins to work like the old state, you'd have to install them manually.
