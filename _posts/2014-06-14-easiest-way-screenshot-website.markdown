If you ever wanted to take a screenshot of an entire webpage or even a part of it, you had to use certain browser plugins or visit some website and type in the web page's name to get the scrrenshot. However, there is a much easier way to do it, without the need of downloading anything.

If you use Firefox, all you need to do to get the screenshot of the entire website is to press **Shift+F2** and then, type "screenshot —-fullpage" (without quotes) in the text field.

This command can be further customized in the following ways:

screenshot —-fullpage —clipboard (if you want to store the image in your clipboard)

screenshot —-fullpage filename (if you want to specify the name of the file)

screenshot (if you just want the screenshot of the current view and not the whole website)

screenshot —-chrome (if you want to display the UI of Firefox)

The screenshot image is a png file which is, by default, stored in your default download directory as specified in Firefox.

For some reason, if you don't have Firefox installed or you want yet another easier way to get a screenshot, there are many websites like [CtrlQ ](http://ctrlq.org/screenshots/)and [Web-Capture](http://web-capture.net/), where all you have to do is to type in the name of your webpage (or website) and you can then download the screenshot of the entire site.
