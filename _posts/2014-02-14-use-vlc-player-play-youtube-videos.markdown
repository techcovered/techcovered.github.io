One of the most underrated feature of VLC media player is its ability to easily play YouTube videos. Now, playing a YouTube video with VLC requires a bit more effort than watching a YouTube video online. The process involves you opening VLC and then pasting the YouTube video link, but if you do take the pain to do this, the video viewing experience is rewarding enough.

To play a YouTube video with VLC, copy the URL of the YouTube video, open VLC and Press Ctrl + N (or go to File > Network Stream) and paste the url and click on the play button. It is as easy as it looks.


### Why use VLC and not the default YouTube Player?


Of late, YouTube has been in a bid to monetize to the maximum, with unskippable [video ads](http://www.techcovered.org/458/youtube-without-distraction), weird [buffering speeds](http://www.techcovered.org/205/proxy-youtube-video), constant video quality changing, lack of a robust [player with complex controls](http://www.techcovered.org/199/control-youtube-with-three-buttons), erratic [video loading](http://www.techcovered.org/414/youtube-buffer-when-paused), etc. There are solutions to these problems, but solving them all together is easier than solving each problem individually.

For instance, YouTube has a large collection of lengthy videos, well exceeding an hour or two, and also has freely viewable movies, documentaries, etc. To view these using YouTube’s video player isn’t as ideal, when compared to the flexibility VLC player offers. For instance, VLC allows you to “fine” fast-forward/rewind (By pressing Shift + right/left arrow key), whereas YouTube’s video player allows you to fast forward only by a large gap. Also, you can add your own subtitle files for a streaming YouTube video in VLC (Tools>Add Subtitle).

VLC also lets you to increase the volume of the video as much as 2 times the original videos’ volume, which is pretty useful at times. VLC also pre-loads your video when you pause the playback, unlike YouTube’s default player which pauses buffering when you pause the video (thus defeating its purpose).

If not VLC, a lot of players support YouTube playback. Some notable ones are [SM Player](http://smplayer.sourceforge.net/), [UM Player](http://www.umplayer.com/), etc. If you have other alternatives, do let me know!
