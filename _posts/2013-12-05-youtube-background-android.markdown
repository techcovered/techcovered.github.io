Even if you have the official YouTube app on Android, you do not have the ability of playing YouTube videos in the background. For example, if you do not have  a particular song or audio track on your phone, you can search for that on YouTube and play it in the background, while you perform other tasks on your phone.

[Viral Floating YouTube App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Mata.YTplayer) is an Android app which is a YouTube video player. It offers almost all the functions of the official YouTube app of Android, but without the same amount of polish. To play a video in the background, you should play the selected video on the player first and then click on the top-right settings bar and click on “Play in Background”.

Even if you minimize the app, or even turn off the screen, the audio still plays in the background. To turn the audio off, open the notification tab and click on the app icon and then stop the video in the player.

This app can also play music videos as a window over the android interface, much like Samsung’s multi-window feature in touchwiz. To do this, tap on the low right side when a video is being played and the video pops out. You can reshape the video to which ever size you want and then use your phone as is, with the video playing side by side.

If for some reasons you are unhappy with the player, then [PV Star](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.asbit.pvstar)+ is an alternate, but doesn’t have as much features as Viral.
