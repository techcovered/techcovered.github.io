We are all used to the convenient “tabs-on-top” web browsers, where the tabs are on top and the website loads below. Not only are these tabs unorganized, they also consume your monitor’s screen height, especially if you have the newer widescreen monitors. If you browse the web a lot, then you must consider changing your current tab position from horizontal to vertical.

[Tree Style Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) is a Firefox extension which many Firefox users swear by. Not only does this extension improve your browsing experience, it also helps manage your browsing sessions more efficiently. Any link opened within a website gets branched into trees or sub-tabs of a particular tab. If more links are opened in the sub-tab, more “sub-sub-tabs” are opened.

Chrome also has a similar extension, called [Sidewise Tree Tabs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sidewise-tree-style-tabs/biiammgklaefagjclmnlialkmaemifgo?hl=en) but it is nowhere as integrated as the one on Firefox. However, it gives you additional features, like “Hibernating” tabs to reduce memory, etc. However, the problem with this extension is that it does not completely remove the top-tabs of chrome, but instead only adds an extra window.
