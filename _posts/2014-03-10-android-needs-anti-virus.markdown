“Android ecosystem has practically no malware and/or viruses. Don’t bother with anti-virus apps, you wont need them. Besides, these anti-virus apps consume lots of RAM and they will eventually slow down your phone.” These are the claims of many people who swear that their phones are free of viruses, without them having an antivirus installed. But how true is this? Is your android phone really not prone to catching any virus at all?

[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="966"][![Download_malware](images/Download_malware_thumb.png)](http://img.techcovered.org/tc/Download_malware.png) If you surf on your device a lot, you get intrusive ads which persuade you to download without your consent. These are malware.[/caption]

The answer is no. Your android device is prone to catch as much viruses , if not more, as much as your PC. If you are among those few who sideload pirated apps (by enabling _unknown sources_ in the settings), you are more likely to catch malware. However, those of you who strictly don’t stray from Google’s Play Store, you are not entirely safe too – there are malware apps in the play store too.

Here’s an example: Avast, in their [blog](https://blog.avast.com/2014/03/07/google-play-whats-the-newest-threat-on-the-official-android-market/), wrote about a particular app “Cámara Visión Nocturna” (removed from play store) which is in fact, a malicious app disguised as a “Night-vision camera app”. The app, during installation, asks for unusual permissions, such as the ability to get accounts and write sms on the device. When Avast’s security team inspected the app, they found out that the app steals your contacts phone numbers from various messenger apps you have installed and subscribes them to a premium SMS service, while also decreasing your account balance in the process.

Here are some ways to keep your phone android virus free: install only reputed apps from the play store, don’t sideload apps from any other source, do not visit malicious websites and install an antivirus app. Speaking of which, which anti-virus app do you go for?

There are many apps of repute, of which I am partial to my favorite – [360 Security](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qihoo.security). It is an excellent app, with a very good detection rate and also the most lightweight antivirus app out there. The best part about this app is that it doesn’t nag you to buy upgrades in order to enable extra features. [Avast for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avast.android.mobilesecurity) is my next favorite, with a good detection rate and clean interface. However, the memory consumption is not exactly ideal, and it isn’t recommended if you have a lower end device. [AVG for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.antivirus) is also a good option.

However, in the end, it is always a game of common sense where anything you do has a potential of getting your phone infected. Be safe out there!
