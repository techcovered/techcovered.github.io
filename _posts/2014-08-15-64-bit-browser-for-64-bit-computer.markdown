Let me lay down the facts for you - 64 bit is the future. As more and more computers and even phones moves towards a 64 bit architecture, you still find that the whole software side is reluctant to move on. A very important category of software, Web Browsers, still reside in the good old 32 bit ecosystem. While 64 bit systems support 32 bit software, the support is not vice-versa, so any software made for 64 bit wouldn't run on 32 bit computers.

So, why would you need a 64 bit browser? First, the performance of a 64 bit browser would be much smoother than a 32 bit browser. For instance, Firefox 32-bit  has a memory limit of around 2 GB, and if the browser exceeds the limit, Firefox would either crash or be sluggishly slow.

Second, with a 64 bit browser, you could open a really large number of tabs or windows, without worrying if your browser can handle the load. With a 64 bit computer, you have the ability to use more than 4GB of RAM, and you browser uses the extra RAM to its benefit.

To help you understand the difference, try loading [this page](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/) in a 32 bit browser. If your browser does not have the required memory, it would just crash or become really slow.


## A List of 64 bit Browsers


If you're convinced to use a 64 bit browser, there's a slight problem - the current web browsers are all 32 bit and none of them _actively_ support 64 bit browsers. But let that not hinder you from using one. Here is a list of unofficial browser ports for 64 bit and some beta/nightly (may be unstable) versions of 64-bit browsers.



	
  1. [Waterfox ](https://www.waterfoxproject.org/)- If Firefox had a 64 bit browser, it would be something like this. All your Firefox extensions work on this perfectly, the only change being a different branding.

	
  2. [Cyberfox](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cyberfox/) - Another 64 bit port of Firefox. It seems to be more updated than Waterfox project.

	
  3. [Firefox x64](http://www.mozilla64bit.com/) - An unofficial 64 bit version of Firefox

	
  4. [Firefox x86_64 Nightlies](http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/) - Firefox's official 64 bit version. These nightly releases maybe unstable.

	
  5. [Chrome 64-bit](http://www.chrome64bit.com/) -  64 bit version of Chrome.

	
  6. [Chrome Beta](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/beta.html) - Chrome Beta lets you download a 64 bit version. It maybe unstable.

	
  7. [Opera 64 bit](http://www.opera64bit.com/) - Opera has a 64 bit version too.
