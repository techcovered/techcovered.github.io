If you surf the internet and have ever encountered long “walls” of text which you didn’t have any time to read but wanted to read anyways? Or have you received a very large email but don’t have the time to read? Or if you are into reading books online, then would you like to improve your reading capability to read books faster?

Believe it or not, but there is a “inner voice” in our head, which actually limits the rate at which we read words. If you were to be shown a very fast rate of words, you can achieve much faster reading speeds than before. Luckily, there are a lot of apps, websites and services which allows us to do this.

[Spreed](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spreed-speed-read-the-web/ipikiaejjblmdopojhpejjmbedhlibno) is a Google Chrome Extension, which allows you to select any text and have it played at you (like the image shown above) at any rate which you specify. All you have to do is right-click and select “Spreed Selected Text”. If you have a large passage of text which needs to be speed read, paste the text in a .txt file and then open it with chrome.

If you are on the internet and do not like a chrome extension to do the task for you, [Spreeder](http://spreeder.com/) is a web service which allows you to speed read. To speed read a text, all you have to do is to paste text on the website and click on “Spreed!”

For those of you who like reading books or long text on your mobile phones, there is an Android app available – [Speed Reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.speedreader&hl=en), which allows you to do the same. This app supports a wide variety of formats, namely, .epub, .pdf, .txt, .html and .xml. [Speed Read](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blueflame.speedreader) is yet another app which allows you to do the same. If you are on an iOS device, [Velocity](http://velocityapp.com/) is the one stop app which allows you superior speed reading capabilities.

Many people have found speed reading to be very helpful and have even told that speed reading drastically improves the speed at which you read large text, offline.
