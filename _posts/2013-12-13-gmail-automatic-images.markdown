Since its inception till yesterday, Gmail had always provided its users with the “Show images (or Always show images)” whenever you receive an email which contains an image or many images. But now, Google has started to automatically display all the images of your emails, regardless of whether you want to see it or not.

From now on, Google renders all images in Gmail from Google’s servers itself, meaning- if you send a person an email containing images, Google is first going to download these images and store it on their servers. This means, when you open the email, you are going to get the images delivered to you from Google’s own servers, instead of the server used by the person who sent the email.

To the normal user, this does not make much difference, apart from the fact that pictures just open by themselves. But for others, like email-marketers, analytics, trackers, it will be almost impossible to track if you open their emails or not.

Trackers and analytics work by sending you an email with an image from their servers being sent to you. Every time you open the email, their server counts the number of times you have opened their mail and read their message. Email marketers will also use that data to send you more (read: spam) emails. But now that Google is handling all the image rendering work, this mechanism will not work anymore, and you are much more safe from being tracked or spammed.

However, if you do not want messages to automatically display images, go to settings and select “Ask before displaying external images”.
