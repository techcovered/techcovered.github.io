So you bought an ebook? Great! Now, how do you intend to read it? Everyone knows that an ebook is not a real substitute for the reading experience you get from reading a hardbound book. However, ebooks have advantages over printed books too. For instance, you can read the same book on multiple devices, add notes, share excerpts with your friends, sync your bookmarks across multiple devices, look up meaning of words, etc.

If you read an ebook the right way, the pleasure and convenience is greater than that of reading a printed book. Here is a list of the best ways to read your ebooks:


## 1. Kindle

The latest generation of [Amazon Kindle](https://kindle.amazon.com/) costs around $79 (with ads) and it is easily one of the best ways to read your ebooks. The e-ink display is easy on the eyes and Amazon's whispernet delivery and very large collection of ebooks make Kindle a must-buy for ebook enthusiasts.

A Kindle device also lets you look up the meaning of words, search Wikipedia, tweet or Facebook (though you should avoid tweeting. Have you tried using a keyboard in an e-ink display? ). Kindle also syncs how much you progressed in your ebooks to Amazon, and you can resume your reading across various other devices using the Kindle app.

Kindle is also super lightweight and can easily fit into any not-large-but-not-medium-either sized pockets easily. Kindles are known for their ability to go for weeks on end with a single charge. However, Kindles are not backlit (a feature, not a drawback). This means you cannot read your beloved books in the dead of the night without a separate light source. But then, neither can you read a printed book in the dark.


## 2. Tablets

If you own a tablet, you have the next best way to read an ebook. A tablet's large screen is ideal for reading an ebook without scrolling too much. There are also a large number of ebook reading apps for Android and iOS.

If you have an Android Tablet, apps such as [Aldiko Reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aldiko.android), [Moon+ Reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flyersoft.moonreader) and [Kindle Reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.kindle) are the best reading apps you can get your hands on. The Kindle app also synchronizes your book progress across Amazon, thereby saving your progress in all your devices including the Kindle reader.

If you own an iPad, iBooks will serve the purpose. However, if you like variety, [Bluefire Reader](https://itunes.apple.com/IN/app/id394275498?mt=8) and [Kindle Reader](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kindle-read-books-ebooks-magazines/id302584613?mt=8) are your best bets.

The two major disadvantages with reading your ebook on your tablet is that the backlight of your tablet might cause a strain on your eyes and continuous reading because painful. Reading for long hours also causes your tablet to heat up, and given its weight, it is not exactly convenient to hold a hot and heavy device which is emitting bright light directed to your eyes.


## 3. Computer

You read that right. When you read a book (say, at home), all you do is remain stationary and concentrate on the text. You can do the same on your computer. So, your computer can also be used as an ebook reader. As simple as that.

If your ebook is in a pdf format, you don't need any special software or application. A normal PDF reader in full screen mode serves the purpose. Also, if you think your display is getting a bit oo bright for you, you can always use a [few tools to optimise your screen's brightness](http://www.techcovered.org/63/using-computer-without-hurting-eyes).

If your ebook is not in a pdf format, you can use [Calibre ](http://calibre-ebook.com/)to read your ebook, convert it into a DRM-free format, convert it into _other_ formats, change the meta tags and more. Calibre is also available for Mac.

If you would like your progress to be synced across devices, you can use [Kindle's Cloud Reader](https://read.amazon.com). There are many other web apps which let you read online, but this is as high quality as it gets. This is also helpful if you own a chromebook and can't afford any space to store your ebook collection.


## 4. Mobile Phone


![phone-reading](http://img.techcovered.org/tc/phone-reading.jpg)

Do you remember what happened when J.K Rowling released the final book of her Harry Potter series? Thousands of Harry Potter fans called in sick and spent the whole time reading the book. Those who were unfortunate enough to not be able to escape from their routines read the books whenever and wherever they could. You could at least spot a few people commuting on public transport reading the 800 page novel. If Rowling had published the book this year, these people would read the ebook on their phones instead of carrying the 800 page monster.

So, why exactly would one want to read an ebook on their phones? The screen is excruciatingly too small to read books in, the phone's battery decreases _exponentially_ every hour you spend reading, your phone gets heated up too often.

The answer is simple. Portability. If you commute a lot, it would be easier to read your books on your phone than to carry your ebook reader or tablet with you at all times. Also, the median of phone's screen size has increased rapidly and you are no longer stuck with a 3.5" or 4" display. Not that a 5" or 6" display makes a significant difference, but every inch counts (:ahem:).

Android or iPhone, the same apps available for tablets are also available for the their smaller sized counterparts.

Unless you are a luddite, you have the accept the change thats sweeping book sales. Ebooks are cheaper than paperback editions and reading ebooks are getting more convenient than ever. Ebooks are the future.
