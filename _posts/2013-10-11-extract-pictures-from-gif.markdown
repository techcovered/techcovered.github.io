GIF animations are really awesome. But have you come across a GIF animation file on the internet, but wanted only a single picture extracted from it? You’re in luck, because that’s exactly what I am going to show you here.

There are many websites that allow you to “explode” a gif into many image frames that make up a gif. The most popular one is [Gif Explode](http://gif-explode.com/), where you enter the url of the gif file and it gives you all the images the gif file is made of. But to save these image files to your computer, you should right click and save image as, and save the image as a .png or .jpg file instead of the standard gif format.

[Picasion](http://picasion.com/get-frames/) and [Ezgif](http://ezgif.com/split) are also worthy alternatives to the above. Picasion takes things to the next level by allotting a direct url to every frame of the exploded gif, so that you can link to the particular frame from anywhere on the internet without having to upload it again.

For more powerful conversion, look no more than [GifSplitter](http://www.xoyosoft.com/gs/), a windows desktop application which is a powerful no-nonsense gif to image converter. It is free to use, and is a very small download. [GIF Frame Extractor](http://www.evanolds.com/#GFE) is also well known and pretty effective at its job.

For those of you who like to do it the hard way, there are [many photoshop tutorials](http://grafikdesign.wordpress.com/2008/11/17/how-to-open-animated-gifs-in-photoshop-cs4/) which show you how to accurately (for professional purposes) extract images from gif animations.
