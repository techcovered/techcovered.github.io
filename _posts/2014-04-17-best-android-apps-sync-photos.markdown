Whether you own an android phone which does not come with expandable memory, or whether you simply want to keep all the photos you capture safe, backing up your photos to the cloud, is always a good idea. There are android apps such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, etc, which let you upload photos manually. But if you would like your phone to automatically sync all photos online, there are apps for that as well.

### 1. [Google+](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.plus)


I bet you didn’t expect to see this here. Yes, Google’s own social network – Google+’s android app lets you backup all your photos to your Google account – for free! To do this, you need to have a Google account and (sadly) the Google+ Android app. To enable this, click on Settings>Auto Backup and toggle it on.

What makes this app stand out is Google’s policy – any photos under 2048 resolution is free to store, and space is not consumed for any amount of photos you upload. Also, the photo you upload aren’t shared to Google+, but saved in Google+, only viewable by you by default.


### 2. [AutoSync for Google Drive](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.drivesync)


If Google+ doesn’t please you, this is another option. No other app takes Google Drive syncing as serious as this one does. This insanely handy app runs in the background and constantly scans for changes in your phone’s gallery (or whichever photo/file folder you specify). Out of all the apps listed, this one is for advanced users, because of the sheer range of options it gives you.

This app covers everything from needing a password to change app settings, to uploading all files/folders to a particular folder in your Google Drive account. To enable more settings, you need to purchase the pro version within the app, but the free version is good enough for simple syncing purposes.


### 3. [Onedrive](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.skydrive)


Microsoft seems to be on the right track when they announced Onedrive (previously known as Skydrive) android app. The app, by default, supports a “camera backup” feature, where all your photos are automatically backed up on onedrive.

You get a default of 7 GB storage free, which might be a little less if you have lots and lots and lots of photos to upload. As a matter of fact, Microsoft _wants_ you to use this feature on your phone, that they actually give you 3 GB of extra free storage if you enable that option in the app.


### 4. [Dropbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dropbox.android)


Dropbox was one of the few apps which first supported automatic syncing of your photos to the cloud. The app still works like a charm, but it comes lower in the list because Dropbox only offers 2 GB of space for free. If you don’t like the official app, here is a third party [dropbox sync app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.dropsync) that does the same for you.

If privacy of your data from the various spy agencies are your special preference, then you may probably not like using Dropbox, especially since [Condoleezza Rice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condoleezza_Rice#Criticism_of_appointment_to_the_Dropbox_board) joined its board of directors. Not that the rest of the other apps are _that_ secure, though.


### 5. [Tresorit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tresorit.mobile)


The elephant in the room had to be eventually addressed. If you are looking for a cloud service which does not look into your uploaded data, even when it may contain “questionable” content, Tresorit is the app you are looking for. Even after a year since it has been launched, Tresorit has claimed to be immune to any sorts of hacks, for which 900 hackers from 45 countries, including the elites from MIT, Stanford, Harvard were unable to crack.

Encryption from tresorit is done from your device, which essentially means that all the files you store online are first encrypted on your phone/device and then stored online. So no one can access your data, even if they wanted to. There are also clients for [Windows](https://tresorit.com/download/windows), [Linux](https://tresorit.com/download/linux) and [Mac](https://tresorit.com/download/mac), but there is no online client to access your files. 5 GB of storage is offered free initially.
