Google recently suspended the Adblock Plus app from the Google Play store, for violating its terms and conditions. Several other ad blocking apps were also taken down from the play store, like Adaway, Adfree, etc.

But Adblock plus just wont budge. It recently made the [android app available from their website](https://adblockplus.org/en/android-install). This relaunched app is independent of the Google Play store, which means that this app can update itself automatically, without requiring the Play store.

To install this app, you would have to do what you usually do to install apps from apk files. You need to enable the "Unknown Sources" option in Settings >Security option, in your android phone.

As for me, I will not be installing this app. Since I monetize my websites through ads, I find it less encouraging for app developers if they have very little/no revenue from their ad-enabled free apps, which might force them to switch to releasing only paid apps.

Use it if you are more than irritated by ads on your phone, else don't. (via [Install Adblock Plus for Android](https://adblockplus.org/en/android))
