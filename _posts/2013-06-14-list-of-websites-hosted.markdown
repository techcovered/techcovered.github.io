Servers can host multiple websites. If the hosting plan that you chose for your website is _Shared_, that means that you share a server with many other websites. The number of websites depend on the hosting company. If the hosting plan is _Dedicated_, implies that yours is the only  website stored on the server.

If you use shared hosting, then you can find the list of other websites that you are sharing your server with. While this may not be that helpful in your website activity, it is still useful to know them. For example, if your website doesn’t load, you can try the other websites to see if its just your website or the server, which is down.

To do this, [Dedicated or Not](dedicatedornot.com) is the best option, providing all details about the server you host your website in, along with all the neighboring websites.  It also fetches your Alexa Backlinks and Alexa Website Rank. [Neighborhood Checker](http://www.majesticseo.com/reports/neighbourhood-checker) is another useful tool by majestic seo, which provides the list of websites in a table. However, some of the sites didn’t seem to load.

Bing can also be used to find the list, but not necessarily of your server. It instead finds IP addresses that is similar to yours. To do so, Search for “ip: <your website’s IP address>”. The list appears on the search results page. To find your website IP address, type “ping <your website address>” in a command prompt in Windows. Also, you can also get it from [GetIP](http://www.getip.com/\).

The more websites that exist on a server, the less is your websites performance. So before you chose a hosting, check the number of websites hosted in a server. Hostgator, the web host I use, currently hosts about 11 websites a server. This may vary for different hosts, so check yours.
