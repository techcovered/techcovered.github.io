Amazon has its own Android App store which competes with Google’s Play store. However, what makes Amazon stand apart is its constant giveaways – including the very popular “free app a day”, where Amazon gives you a paid app for free.

Some apps which amazon offers for free aren’t that great or popular – however, Amazon is known for providing popular apps like Riptide GP 2, Angry Birds, Plants VS Zombies, etc, all of which are very popular paid apps on Google’s play store, for free.

To get any of these paid apps for free, you need to install [Amazon’s App Store](http://www.amazon.com/mobile-apps/b?node=2350149011) on your phone, and check the app everyday for free apps. But how would you like to get notifications of these free paid apps everyday,without installing the app store on your phone or without bothering to check the app or the website daily?

IFTTT offers a channel based on the [pushbullet app for android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pushbullet.android), through which you can push notifications from anywhere, to your phone and vice versa. To get notifications to your phone for every free paid app amazon releases, you need to use the following recipe, after installing the pushbullet app on your phone.

[![IFTTT Recipe: If new Amazon.com free Android app of the day, then send me a link connects feed to pushbullet](https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/154799)](https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/154799-if-new-amazon-com-free-android-app-of-the-day-then-send-me-a-link)

Now, every time a paid app is released for free in Amazon, you get a notification message –which you can choose to install or ignore (depending upon which app is being offered for free). This works because IFTTT sends you a notification every time a new feed is added, which is linked to Amazon’s app store updates.

Do remember to add the pushbullet app to your phone’s task killer app’s ignore-list (if you are using one), so that none of these notifications miss you.
