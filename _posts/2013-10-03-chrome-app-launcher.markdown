If you frequently use Chrome, then you would have noticed that the recent version of Chrome (version 29) packs in a lot of new updates and UI changes. One of them is the new, redesigned “New Tab” page (to search Google directly) and the other one is the introduction of the new “App Launcher”. A button you click to list out all your apps. It’s pretty neat.

However, what’s more awesome about this is that the app launcher can be extended outside of chrome and can be displayed and accessed from your desktop. Normally, as soon as you get the update, the app launcher is automatically added to your taskbar and an icon is placed on your desktop. However, if you do not have it there, simply right click and create a shortcut, and paste this in the target (depending on your chrome installation directory):

    
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --show-app-list


Almost all popular website has “apps” which are nothing more than fancy bookmarks, like [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube/blpcfgokakmgnkcojhhkbfbldkacnbeo), [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gmail/pjkljhegncpnkpknbcohdijeoejaedia) and [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/facebook/boeajhmfdjldchidhphikilcgdacljfm). In fact, the only reviews and ratings these “apps” get are the way their icons look. With the Chrome app launcher, you can easily access your “app” website and also other apps, directly from windows itself.
