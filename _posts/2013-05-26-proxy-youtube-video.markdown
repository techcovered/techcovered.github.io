Many people have fast internet connections, but it is often useless as some ISP’s tend to slow down YouTube video buffering in order for them to save bandwidth. So what do you do to make YouTube videos load faster? Use a proxy!

Yes, you heard it right! While a proxy is notorious for its slow speed in which it loads web pages, you would be _amazed_ at the speed some proxy sites load YouTube videos (or any internet video in general). The proxy sites not only provide their own custom video player for YouTube videos, but also tend to cloak the packets you receive from YouTube into their own.

The proxy site I recommend is **[Proxfree](http://www.proxfree.com/)**, which is a swell service, considering the proxied pages load fast, without the site forcing its ads on the page. The website uses flowplayer as its video player (so your YouTube shortcuts wont work there), ensuring a hitch-free video experience.

YouTube also loads up pretty fast with many other proxy sites, with my next favorite being **[HideMyAss](http://hidemyass.com/)** (not exactly a family friendly name). Though it is a bit slow, the page load speed did nothing to reduce the YouTube video stream quality.

Not only do these work for YouTube but also for other video streaming websites. Besides this, you also get the feature proxy sites are famous for – anonymity. If YouTube is blocked in your office, home or college, this is your best bet to watch videos in full speed. Facebook, Twitter and not to mention adult sites, also can be accessed.
