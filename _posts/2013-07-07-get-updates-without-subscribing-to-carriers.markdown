Do you ever get messages and calls from your mobile carriers (or mobile networks), asking you to subscribe to sports packages or “follow” updates of celebrities,etc for a fee? If you ever subscribed to these “plans”, you get charged a lot, and also, a lot of carries auto renew your subscription every cycle. The options to unsubscribe to them is not that clear and some carriers deliberately hide them behind a huge list of options.

So how do you get these updates without relying on your mobile carrier?

![twitter_logo](https://techcovered.github.io/images/twitter_logo.jpg)Subscribing to SMS alerts at **[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com)** is the best answer this question can get. Twitter, since long, provides mobile SMS service with which you can get updates of people who you follow directly via SMS. Twitter SMS works in almost all countries and most probably supports your carrier as well. The best part of Twitter SMS is that, it is free of charge.


## Setting up SMS alerts from Twitter


If you don’t have one already, create a twitter account and follow the necessary accounts which contain your interests. If you are into sports updates, accounts like [@espn](http://www.twitter.com/espn), [@twittersports](http://www.twitter.com/twittersports), [@yahoosports](http://www.twitter.com/yahoosports) are examples of accounts to follow. There are also many specific accounts for football, cricket, etc which you can get with a twitter search. Celebrities also use twitter, so you can also catch up with their updates.

Once you follow the accounts of your interest, go to [Settings > Mobile](https://twitter.com/settings/devices) and link your mobile number with your twitter account. Enable the “Tweets from people you've enabled for mobile notifications” option and click on Save changes.

In your **[following](https://twitter.com/following)** accounts, click on the button next to following, and select “Turn on mobile notifications”. Do this to whatever accounts you wish to get updates from.

_Note: Do note that subscribing to a lot of accounts will result in your inbox being constantly flooded with SMSes, so subscribe with care._
