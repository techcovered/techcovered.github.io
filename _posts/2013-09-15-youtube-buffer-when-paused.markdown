The older YouTube player was much cooler. If a video started to load slowly, you could just pause the video and YouTube would load the rest of the video and you could just hit the play button to watch the video without any pauses. Then, the new YouTube happened and changes were made to video player. So now, if you pause a video, the buffering (loading of the video) stops.  Fortunately, there is way to overcome it.

[YouTube Center](https://github.com/YePpHa/YouTubeCenter/wiki) is a add on for browsers which allows you to control YouTube in many ways. There is a browser extension for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/youtube-center/), Chrome, [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/youtube-center/), [Safari](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13162258/YouTube%20Center/YouTubeCenter.safariextz), [Maxathon](http://extension.maxthon.com/detail/index.php?view_id=1201) and even [Internet Explorer](https://github.com/YePpHa/YouTubeCenter/wiki/How-to-use-YouTube-Center-with-Internet-Explorer). There is no chrome store link for this addon, so if you are using chrome, you have to [download it manually](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13162258/YouTube%20Center/YouTubeCenter.crx) and then go to Settings > Extensions and drag and drop the extension from your computer to chrome ([See picture](images/drop-to-install-chrome.png)).

Once installed, fire up your browser and click on "Go to Settings".  In the Player tab, clear the box for "Dash Playback". Then, reload YouTube. From now on, if you pause your video, YouTube will automatically buffer the video.

This extension can also be used to customize the whole of YouTube, including stopping auto-play, automatically darkening the background when a video is playing, automatically setting a resolution for default video playback, download button to automatically download the video on a single click, etc. Over all, this extension is all you need to make YouTube awesome.
