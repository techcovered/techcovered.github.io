Whenever someone talks about encoding secret messages, they always talk about encrypting it while it is being sent from one person to another. Sending such encryptions can only arouse suspicions by people who are trying to snoop into your email. So how can you send secret messages (through email, for example) without arousing any doubt?

[Spam Mimic](http://www.spammimic.com/) is the (only) website that lets you convert your text into – spam. You heard it right. This website encodes your secret message into a spam message, which you can send it to any person without any need of encryption. The spam mail can then be decoded by that person via the same website to get the original message.

Since this message is not encrypted, there is a high possibility that if someone comes to know that this message hides another text, it can be easily decoded. However, the idea is to prevent these people from knowing that there is a secret message in the first place.

Another tip is to not use your own email ID while sending the message. It would seem suspicious when someone finds your “spam” emails in your recipients inbox. You can create another email account from an email provider like Gmail, Yahoo or Outlook, or use anonymous email services like [this one](http://www.sendanonymousemail.net/) and [this one](http://www.anonymailer.net/).

The “spam” which you send will most likely end up in your recipients spam folder, so you should inform your recipient before hand.
