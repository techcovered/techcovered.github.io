Faxes are more than 50 years old and still finds frequent use in offices around the world. The internet can be used to easily replace them, but yet, the convenience of directly obtaining a hard copy of a document is worth the trouble of paying extra for a fax machine and a phone line. However, you don’t always have to pay for sending faxes: the internet lets you send faxes for free!

**[HelloFax](https://www.hellofax.com/)** is a online fax sending service, which among its many paid options, lets you send a limited amount of free faxes, to any international number – for free, of course. Hellofax also has a $10/month service, which gives you a custom fax number, so that you can receive faxes send to that number.

Hello fax also lets you “sign” your documents before you send them, which is an added benefit for those who send official documents (if the document is too important, you should probably send it without trusting the internet). This is their [pricing information](https://www.hellofax.com/info/pricing).

Hellofax initially offers about 5 faxes free for a free user. However, if the user completes a few actions (like tweeting about them, inviting your friends,etc), you get rewarded with extra “faxes”. There is also an offer which gives a user 50 faxes free per month if he uses their [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hellofax-50-free-fax-page/bocmleclimfnadgmcdgecijlblfcmfnm).

Another added feature of hellofax is that they have a [Google Docs Add-on](https://www.hellofax.com/google-docs-add-on). This makes it particularly very easy for you to send faxes within Google Doc’s interface.

But what happens if you run out of free faxes to send? You can try using another email ID to send more faxes, or just use the ol’ gmail trick to generate more email IDs* from your single gmail one.

[*] If you have a gmail ID, for example, abc@gmail.com, you can make many variants of the same email ID to register yourself multiple times on any website, without the need of using any other email ID. For instance, abc@gmail.com is as same as a.bc@gmail.com or ab.c@gmail.com or a.b.c@gmail.com. Basically, you can put as much dots between different characters of your email ID and use them as different IDs.
