If you own a website or blog, you'd heard of Google Authorship (which makes the author's picture appear next to search results). The easiest way to apply for it is to [follow the instructions ](https://plus.google.com/authorship)prescribed by Google.

If you have successfully linked your profile to your website, then your picture will probably appear along with your website's search results. You can type in your websites name in the [rich snippets tool](www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets) and verify if you've properly set it up. However, there are some restrictions that will stop your profile from appearing in search results.

If you are under 18 years of age, Google Authorship wont be displayed for your website. Now, Google does not actually find out your age, but relies on the date of birth which you provided while signing up for your Google account.

For example, techcovered.org is a fairly recent, though a bit old website of mine. Having set up Google Authorship for it on the very first day, and having it successfully verified by the rich snippets tool, the actual search result contains no authorship data and is simply provided as an ordinary search result. This is because I'm 17 years old, one year less than 18.

Once you create a Google account, it is not possible for you to change your date of birth.

To avoid this problem, one solution is to create another Google account with a false date of birth (which may/may not violate Google TOS - I didn't read). Another solution is to wait till you're 18, which is probably going to be my case.
