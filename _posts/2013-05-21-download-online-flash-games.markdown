Online games may not exactly win the best game of the year award, but some of them are nonetheless addictive and highly playable games. The biggest disadvantage of online games are – well, they need to be played online. For those without a consistent internet connection or no internet at all, you have an option. You can download them from a computer connected to the internet and play them offline.

There are many ways to download a flash game. Here, I use **Google Chrome** and Firefox as it comes with a developer tool. The same can also be done with Opera, IE9 or IE10. Hell, you can do it in any modern browser.


## Usual Method


The first step is to go over to the web page with your flash game. Right click somewhere near the flash game and select **Inspect Element **(do not right click ON the game, it just brings out the Flash player options). Press **Ctrl** + **F** and in the search bar, type **_.swf _**.

This is the hard part. In the HTML code part, look out for an “embed” or “iframe” tag, which holds the URL of game. The game URL ends with a .swf . Copy this URL and paste it in your browser address bar. If you extracted the correct URL, then the game starts to load. Press **Ctrl** + **S **and save the file to your computer.


## Much more simpler method (Firefox)


Firefox users, having [Adblock ](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/)installed, can see a “[_block_](images/block-button-adblock.png)” tab on all flash and Java elements on the internet [_If you can’t, click on the ABP button and select options>Show tabs on Flash and Java_].

Click on the “Block” button and in the custom field is the URL of the flash game [Don’t click “_Add filter_” unless you want to never be able to play that game online]. Copy the URL, open it in a new tab, press Ctrl + S to save it to your computer.


## Opening flash games (or any flash content for that matter)


[![flash-chrome-icon](images/flash-chrome-icon_thumb.png)](http://img.techcovered.org/tc/flash-chrome-icon.png)Now that the flash game is downloaded in your computer, you’d probably be wondering on how to actually play it. Right click on the file, select Open With>Choose Program. In the list that follows, select **Google Chrome**.

Why chrome? – The flash will most probably work with Firefox too, but only if you have Flash installed in your computer. Google Chrome comes with flash pre-installed in its browser, so flash content can open without it being actually installed in your computer.

Now that the game is downloaded, [what are you waiting for](https://www.google.com/search?q=top+online+games)?
