Among the recent interface changes by Twitter, the most welcomed addition is the support for dragging and dropping images to the twitter status to upload it.

If you want to upload an image and post it in your twitter status, just drag it from your computer and drop it in the twitter status box, either in the homepage or by clicking the blue “Tweet” icon at the top right corner.

Among other changes, Twitter has also added a more simple way to change your bio and profile picture, simply by clicking on them on your profile. Though this update is not rolled out on everyone, it is expected to be gradually released.
