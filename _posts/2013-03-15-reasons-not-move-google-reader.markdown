Google announced its plans to close down Google Reader for good, from July 1st, 2013. However, unlike other Google-product-closure announcements, this created a lot of anger around the internet, with hundreds of tweets and almost the same number of blog posts venting out against Google and also giving out a list of alternatives to Google Reader.

But don't move away from Reader just yet! Here are the reasons why:


## 1) Better alternates are on its way:


When Google Reader's announcement came out, other online feed readers, namely Feedly, etc. sighed a heave of relief as they were much far behind Google Readers user base. **Feedly** even promised a [seamless, smooth transition ](http://blog.feedly.com/2013/03/14/google-reader/)from reader. Many liked it, many didn't. For starter, they have feedly for everything - Android, iOS, Firefox, Chrome, Safari. So you might actually end up liking them there.

Since this article isn't really about other Reader alternatives, here is a list of them:



	
  * [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com)

	
  * [Netvibes](www.netvibes.com)

	
  * [Newsblur](http://www.newsblur.com)

	
  * [The old reader](http://theoldreader.com)

	
  * [Bloglines](www.bloglines.com)


Another reader worth mentioning is [Digg's yet-to-be-named reader](http://blog.digg.com/post/45355701332/were-building-a-reader), which they are working on, promising a worthy replacement. If you don't like any of these readers, waiting for Digg (and many other on-the-way readers) might as well be worth the wait, while you are using Google Reader till July.


## 2) Google may change its mind and not close it:


While this is highly unlikely, chances are that Google may change its mind and not close down Reader. Reasons? Because the whole internet is scorning at Google, in Twitter ([see picture](http://img.techcovered.org/tc/google-reader-twitter-complain.png)), [Blog posts](https://www.google.com/search?q=google+reader&tbm=nws), and even in many [national ](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/internet/Google-draws-users-ire-for-killing-Reader/articleshow/18986061.cms)[media](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/03/14/alternatives-to-google-reader/) [newspapers](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/the-end-of-google-reader-sends-internet-into-an-uproar/).

Another reason is [Google Reader has a bigger user base than Google+](http://www.buzzfeed.com/jwherrman/google-reader-still-sends-far-more-traffic-than-google). There is also an [online petition ](https://www.change.org/petitions/google-keep-google-reader-running)with as many as 107,000+ signatures opposing the removal of Google Reader (Don't forget to sign the petition yourself!).


## 3) Social media cannot replace RSS:


If you think your Facebook/twitter account can compensate for the lack of RSS reader, then you are making a mistake. Your Facebook/twitter account (when subscribed to any other blog/source) may or may not display any new content on a website, and instead, may display many other useless updates, like promotional offers, what the blog/website author had for lunch, etc.

So, With another 100+ days to go before Google Reader actually shuts down, I suggest you enjoy the last days with the beloved Reader, until you find someone new who is worth your love and won't ditch you and leave you forever.Â  :sob:
