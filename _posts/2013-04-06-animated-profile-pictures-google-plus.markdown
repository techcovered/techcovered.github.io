Google showed its love for .gif animations, adding support for gif profile pictures in Google+. This means that you can make an animated version of your profile picture, like a waving gesture or a flying kiss gesture (the possibilities are endless), for Google+.

Not only would the animated profile picture be displayed whenever someone views your profile, but it'll be displayed even on the homepage of Google, where your avatar usually appears. The animation works even when viewed from a mobile phone, with the exception of iOS.


## How to create an animated profile picture


**a)** The first step is to take a video of you (or anything you like) that you want to appear animated. You can do so from your digital camera or your webcam, but make sure it is short (within 10 seconds) so as to not make the file size large.

**b)** Now that your video is ready, you need to convert it to avi or mpeg format. If it is already in the given format, skip this step. Else, you would have to download a video converter, like [Total Video Converter](http://www.effectmatrix.com/total-video-converter/) or similar, to convert it to either avi or mpeg format.

**c)** The most important (and hence difficult) step is to convert the video to a gif animation. There are many websites that do this for you. However, they end up adding a huge watermark across the animation. The only website I found to do this without the additional watermark was [Gifninja](http://gifninja.com).

If you are familiar with photoshop, then you'd know how to [create a gif](https://www.google.com/search?q=photoshop+video+to+gif). Another alternative would be to try software converters, like [Free Video to Gif Converter](http://www.video-gif-converter.com/) and many more available on the internet.

Another less bothersome move is to use Camcastia to record the screencast of your video playing, and export it to a gif animation file. You can try any of these methods, which will in the end, lead you to have a gif animation of the video on your computer.

**[ Hint:** If you do not want to use your video as an animation, you can search for other gif animations by using Google Image Search and selecting **Animation** from the** Search Tools > Any Type **option. **]**

**d) **Login to your Google+ account and upload the new gif animation as your profile picture.

You are done! You now have an animated profile picture, that looks exactly like the photographs in Harry Potter.

**Note:** Though twitter used to support animated gif as its avatar, it later discontinued them. Facebook has no word on gif for profile pictures, but it isn't possible to animate your profile pictures on Facebook.
