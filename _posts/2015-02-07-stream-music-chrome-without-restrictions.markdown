Streaming music legally is not that much of a problem anymore.

You have Spotify, Pandora, etc where you pay a small fee for unlimited access to music and on the other hand, there is Grooveshark, where you can stream a wide range of music for free. Also, Spotify, Pandora and other related services have their own mobile apps, though Grooveshark doesn't.

In India, sites like gaana and saavn are streaming services which have a large local variety of music. Then, there is always [Youtube Music](https://www.youtube.com/music) where you can stream music videos for free.

[Streamus ](https://streamus.com)is a Google Chrome extension which lets you stream music from YouTube. It is all very simple: All you have to do is install the extension and then click on search and type a song name and click on the search results to play the song.

Streamus has a playlist support, it can save playlists locally - though you need an internet connection to actually play the songs. It also has a radio mode which plays music similar to the one being played. Basic functionality like looping the track/playlist, shuffle is also supported.

Streamus only supports Google Chrome at the moment. There is no word on any support for Firefox or any other browser.
