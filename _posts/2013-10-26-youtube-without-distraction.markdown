There are [many](http://www.techcovered.org/414/youtube-buffer-when-paused) plugins for YouTube that promise to offer you a distraction free, clear YouTube , but there is a way to get a much more clean, and much more faster YouTube, without any of that.

"[Feather Beta](http://www.youtube.com/feather_beta)” is a YouTube opt-in, in which YouTube is working on a latency-free and clean method to stream YouTube Videos to you, without much lag or slow loading, and without most features too. Basically, it is just for those of you, who want to just watch videos and get on with their daily lives, instead of social sharing, commenting on videos, embedding on your website, etc.

So how does YouTube look like in the “feather” mode? Like this:

As you can see, there is no social sharing, comments, embed script, transcript and thankfully, no Google+ (Look at the top right corner!!). The videos loaded pretty quickly too.

You can [opt in](http://www.youtube.com/feather_beta) this beta if you want. However, if you do not want your ENTIRE YouTube experience to be this boring, you can add a “ &nofeather=True ” at the end of the video url to make YouTube return to its normal state. For example, if _http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TThHnoxHrFQ_ is a video, then you can get the normal version of the video at _http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TThHnoxHrFQ&nofeather=True_

You can also opt-out of the beta by going to [this page](http://www.youtube.com/feather_beta) and clicking “Leave Beta”.
