Whether it is a coding session or any other work that requires you to be in front of your computer for a long time, it is always very easy to get distracted and lose track of your valuable time. If you really cannot afford to miss that deadline, here are some apps and online services which help you keep track of your time and also manage it efficiently.


### 1. [Rescue Time](http://www.rescuetime.com/)

Rescue time keeps a log of all activities you do on your computer, and categorizes them into “Business”, “Social Networking”, “Entertainment” or “Design and composition”, etc. To do this, it needs you to install a small logging client on your computer. The desktop app not only monitors applications opened, but also the websites your browsers visit. Once installed, you get daily logs, email messages and reminders of how productive you are.  Rescue time also has a pro version, giving you features like blocking time-wasting websites, advanced tracking, etc.


### 2. [Slife Web](http://www.slifeweb.com/)

Slife Web also offers similar tracking, but not as through as rescue time. This service needs you to install a desktop client and monitors your processes to display a detailed log on its website. The interface might not exactly win any awards, but it does serve its purpose. You also have the ability to write notes and save them to the website’s cloud, even through its desktop client.


### 3. [Toggl](https://www.toggl.com/)

Toggl is a time management app with a twist – it does not record what you do on your computer, but instead, it expects you to manually enter your current tasks, and then displays them as a list. This app asks you “What have you done?” (which is likely to make an unproductive professional sweat in guilt). When you fill in the field, it starts a timer, which you can stop conveniently when you finish the task. Toggl’s interface is very pleasing to the eye and is recommended for people looking for easy time management. They also have a [mobile version](https://m.toggl.com/) of the website.


### 4. Distraction Free Browsing


If you would like to go the extra step and excommunicate yourself with the outer world of unproductivity, status updates and cat photos, you can use the many browser plugins which enable you to browse only non-time wasting websites.

[StayFocusd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en) is one of my favorite browser plugin. Though it works only for chrome, it plays a vital role whenever I get bored of my work and subconsciously resort to the internet for entertainment. For Firefox users, [Leechblock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock/) does the trick. These plugins can be configured to allow and block any number of websites, which you may find distracting.
