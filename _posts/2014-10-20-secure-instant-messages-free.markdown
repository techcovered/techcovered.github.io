There are a very less percentage of people who still use Instant Messengers on their computers. IMs are made irrelevant, thanks to the advent of online messengers like Facebook, Google Hangouts, and also mobile clients like Whatsapp, Viber, etc. However, as of now, no messenger provides complete encryption of user data and chats, from spying by third party (read: NSA).

This is where Tox comes in. Tox is a still-in-development instant messenger, which lets you send and receive chats, which is completely encrypted and cannot be read by any third party while the chat is being transmitted. Tox is a distributed chat messenger, which means that there is no server involved in between the two or more people in conversation.

Tox is also feature rich. The desktop client of Tox allows you to make audio and video calls for free. Tox also allows multiple recipient styled group chat.

Tox also has mobile clients - Antox (short for Android Tox) and Antidote (for iOS). However, the apps are still in the alpha stage and are buggy. They are not available on the official app stores. You have to download [F-droid](https://f-droid.org/) and add a repository  to the app to install it on Android ([More about that](https://wiki.tox.im/Binaries#Mobile_clients)) and the same applies for iOS users, who need Cydia Jailbreak to use this messenger.

Since Tox is open source, there are a lot of Clients built for it - each with a unique skin and a slightly different set of features, ranging from Command line messaging to Metro Style UI. You can choose your favorite version from [this list](https://wiki.tox.im/Client) and download the client you like.

Tox is available for Windows, OSX, Linux, FreeBSD, Android and iOS. Tor is still in the alpha stage, so do exercise caution while using it and not trust it 100%, at least till the project reaches a final stage.

It is also recommended that in case you want complete anonymity, to use Tox with Tor. They have a [guide](https://wiki.tox.im/Tox_over_Tor_(ToT)) to do this on multiple platforms.
