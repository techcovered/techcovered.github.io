There may be many many mobile messengers out there, but nothing beats whatsapp (yet). But what is annoying, is that every time you use whatsapp, your friends can see your “Last seen” time when you had been active on whatsapp. This would really suck, especially when your boss adds you on whatsapp and he sees you online at a very late time, or when you called in sick.

Since whatsapp is available for majority all phones, here are two methods which will work on all phones, to avoid the “Last Seen” monster.


## #1. Airplane Mode it.


Whenever you get a message on whatsapp and you want to read the message without getting spotted by the evil “last seen”, turn on the “airplane mode” in your phone.

Once airplane mode is activated, your wi-fi and data connection is temporarily disabled. You can then read your message without worries of getting spotted. You can also reply to your contacts (except the ones you are avoiding, of course), and after you are done, come out of whatsapp and then disable airplane mode.

When your data connection/wi-fi is back, your message will be sent, without you being detected by whatsapp. If you don’t like to put your phone in airplane mode, then just disable your data and wi-fi connection every time you need to open whatsapp.


## #2. The App Way.


Method #1 is the one easy way to do it, but if you ask any smartphone user, an app is what it takes to keep them happy.

For iPhone users, Go to Settings>Chat Settings>Advanced and turn off “Last Seen Timestamp”. That’s it.

For Android users, there are many apps which make method #1 easier. For example, [Hide-Whatsapp-Status](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hidewhatsappstatus) app makes you press a button to disable your data and wi-fi and opens whatsapp. For Windows Phone 8 users, hahahaha (Use method #1).

Do you know of any other apps or methods to make this simpler? Do comment.
