Liberty City, the city of sins in the Grand Theft Auto series, can now be thoroughly explored (in the safety of your home) with… wait for it… Street View!

Yes, you heard it right. The kind geeks at [Gta4.net](http://www.gta4.net), a GTA 4 fan site, has used Google Maps’ API to implement a map of Liberty City, with street view. The map not only includes this goodness, but also specifies various points on the map, where you get health, armor, weapon pickups along with window cleaning platforms.

You can view the map **[here](http://www.gta4.net/map/)**. Like Google Maps, click on  ![](http://media.gtanet.com/gta4/images/streetview/streetview-marker.png) and drag it on to the map.

_So how did they do it_? With knowledge of Google Maps API (and that of a hardcore GTA 4 fan) you could [build one for yourself](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=476068), only if you have about 3,000 panoramas, along with 80,000 screenshots of the game (high resolution) and over a million set of images (or tiles).

For the best viewing pleasure. click on the top right corner of the map for full screen and also press the F11 button to enable full screen in your browser.
